File:TOPIO 3.0.jpg|350px|thumb|TOPIO, a robot, played tennis at Tokyo Robot Exhibition (IREX) 2009.(Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents( where an agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.( John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956,( defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.(The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligencethe sapience of sapienscan be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine.(See the Dartmouth proposal, under Philosophy, below.) This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.( Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism,(The optimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers (see optimism in the history of AI) as well as the ideas of modern transhumanists such as Kurzweil.) but has also suffered setbacks(The setbacks referred to include the ALPAC report of 1966, the abandonment of perceptrons in 1970, the Lighthill Report of 1973 and the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987.) and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.(AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.( Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.( General intelligence (or AI) is still among the fields long term goals.( HistoryThinking machines and artificial beings appear in myths, such as Talos of Crete, the bronze robot of Hephaestus, and Pygmalions Galatea.( Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization: animated images were worshipped in Egypt and Greece( and humanoid automatons were built by Yan Shi, of Alexandria and Al-Jazari.( It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by ibn Hayyn, Loew and Paracelsus.( By the 19th and 20th centuries, artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction, as in Shelleys Frankenstein or apeks (Rossums Universal Robots).( McCorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge, as she describes it, to forge the gods.( Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes, fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence.Mechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity. The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer, based on the work of mathematician Turing and others. Turings of computation suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.(This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the thesis.)( This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurology, theory and cybernetics, inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.(The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of College in the summer of 1956.( The attendees, including John McCarthy, Minsky, Newell and Simon, became the leaders of AI research for many decades.( They and their students wrote programs that were, to most people, simply astonishing:(Russell and Norvig write it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish. ) computers were solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.( By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense( and laboratories had been established around the world.( AIs founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field: Simon predicted that machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do and Minsky agreed, writing that within a generation ... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved.(They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.(See ) In 1974, in response to the criticism of James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI. The next few years, when funding for projects was hard to find, would later be called the winter.(In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of systems,( a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japans generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field.( However, beginning with the collapse of the Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer lasting winter began.(In the 1990s and early 21st century, AI achieved its greatest successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence is used for logistics, mining, diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industry.(The success was due to several factors: the increasing computational power of computers (see law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.(On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Kasparov.() In 2005, a Stanford robot won the Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail.(DARPA Grand Challenge  home page)In February 2011, in a Jeopardy! show exhibition match, IBMs answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Rutter and Jennings, by a significant margin.()The leading-edge definition of artificial intelligence research is changing over time. One pragmatic definition is: AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do cost-effectively today. For example, in 1956 character recognition (OCR) was considered AI, but today, sophisticated OCR software with a context-sensitive checker and checker software comes for free with most scanners. No one would any longer consider already-solved computing science problems like OCR artificial intelligence today.Low-cost entertaining chess-playing software is commonly available for tablet computers. DARPA no longer provides significant funding for chess-playing computing system development. The Kinect which provides a 3D bodymotion interface for the 360 uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research,(Kinects AI breakthrough explained) but few consumers realize the technology source.AI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of of defense R&D, but are now common place consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toys.In common usage, the term AI no longer seems to apply to off-the-shelf solved computing-science problems, which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research. Problems Can a machine act intelligently? is still an problem. Taking A machine can act intelligently as a hypothesis, many researchers have attempted to build such a machine.The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.(Deduction, reasoning, problem solving Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.( By the late 1980s and 90s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.(For difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources  most experience a explosion: the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.(Human beings solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.( AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of sub-symbolic problem solving: agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning; net research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skill.Knowledge representationright|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.representation( and engineering( are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;( situations, events, states and time;( causes and effects;( knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);( and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of what exists is an ontology (borrowing a word from traditional philosophy), of which the most general are called upper ontologies.(Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:;reasoning and the problem: Many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions. For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969( as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.(;The breadth of knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering  they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.( A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.;The subsymbolic form of some knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed() or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake.() These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non-consciously and sub-symbolically.( Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI or intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.(PlanningImage:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A control system is a form of system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.( They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or value) of the available choices.(In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.( However, if this is not true, it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.(planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. behavior such as this is used by algorithms and intelligence.(Learninglearning( has been central to AI research from the beginning.(Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper Machinery and Intelligence. ) In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: An Inductive Inference Machine.((pdf scanned copy of the original) (version published in 1957, An Inductive Inference Machine, IRE Convention Record, Section on Information Theory, Part 2, pp. 56-62))learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. learning includes both classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression takes a set of numerical input/output examples and attempts to discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs. In learning( the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. These can be analyzed in terms of theory, using concepts like utility. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of computer science known as learning theory.(Natural language processingFile:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some grammar.language processing( gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak. Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own, by reading the existing text available over the internet. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include retrieval (or mining) and translation.(Motion and manipulationThe field of robotics( is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation( and navigation, with sub-problems of localization (knowing where you are), mapping (learning what is around you) and planning (figuring out how to get there).(Perceptionperception( is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. vision( is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are recognition,( facial recognition and recognition.(Social intelligencerobot at MIT Museum.jpg|thumb|Kismet, a robot with rudimentary social skillsEmotion and social skills( play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of theory, theory, as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, for good interaction, an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions. At the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with. At best, it should have normal emotions itself.CreativityA sub-field of AI addresses creativity both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). A related area of computational research is Intuition and Imagination.General intelligenceMost researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence (known as AI), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.( A few believe that anthropomorphic features like consciousness or an brain may be required for such a project.((Many of the problems above are considered AI-complete: to solve one problem, you must solve them all. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like translation requires that the machine follow the authors argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the authors intention (social intelligence). translation, therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require AI to be done as well as humans can do it.( Approaches There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.(Nils Nilsson writes: Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about .) A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to engineering?(Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?(Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require sub-symbolic processing?(John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as intelligence, a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi10.1.1.38.8384&reprep1&typepdfhttp://books.google.com/books?hlen&lr&ida_ZR81Z25z0C&oifnd&pgPA63&dqrelated:iCpuTpmGk6gJ:scholar.google.com/&otsn1-TsvqXGJ&sig1xthOJ2WQmKtdSt7ISFH2yu2l3Q#vonepage&q&ffalsehttp://www.imagination-engines.com/ Cybernetics and brain simulation is currently no consensus on how closely the brain should be simulated.In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology, theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as Grey Walters turtles and the Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at University and the Club in England.( By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s. Symbolic When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: CMU, Stanford and MIT, and each one developed its own style of research. Haugeland named these approaches to AI good old fashioned AI or GOFAI.(; Cognitive simulation: Economist Simon and Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as science, research and science. Their research team used the results of  psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s.((; Logic-based: Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.( His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including representation, planning and learning.( Logic was also focus of the work at the of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of programming.(; Anti-logic or scruffy: Researchers at MIT (such as Minsky and Papert)( found that solving difficult problems in vision and language processing required ad-hoc solutions  they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Schank described their anti-logic approaches as scruffy (as opposed to the neat paradigms at CMU and Stanford).( knowledge bases (such as Lenats Cyc) are an example of scruffy AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.(; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.( This knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of systems (introduced by Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.( The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications. Sub-symbolic During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.(The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of perceptrons by Minsky and Papert in 1969. See of AI, winter, or Rosenblatt.) By the 1980s, however, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and recognition. A number of researchers began to look into sub-symbolic approaches to specific AI problems.(; Bottom-up, embodied, situated, behavior-based or AI: Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.( Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of theory in AI. This coincided with the development of the mind thesis in the related field of science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as  movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.; Computational Intelligence: Interest in networks and connectionism was revived by Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s.( These and other sub-symbolic approaches, such as systems and computation, are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of intelligence.(StatisticalIn the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AIs recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or research). Stuart Russell and Norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats.( Critiques argue that these techniques are too focussed on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence. Integrating the approaches ;Intelligent agent paradigm: An agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works  some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fieldssuch as theory and economicsthat also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.(;architectures and architectures: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting agents in a system.( A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a intelligent system, and the study of such systems is intelligence systems integration. A control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.( Brooks architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.( Tools In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below. Search and optimization Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:( Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an rule.( Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called analysis.( Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in space.( Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.Simple exhaustive searches( are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called pruning the tree). Heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies.(A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are annealing, search and optimization.(computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of computation include intelligence algorithms (such as ant colony or swarm optimization)( and algorithms (such as algorithms and programming).( Logic Logic( is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning( and logic programming is a method for learning.(Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional or logic( is the logic of statements which can be true or false. logic( also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. logic,( is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. logic( models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty  1 within a distribution. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.logics, logics and circumscription( are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: logics;( calculus, calculus and calculus (for representing events and time);( causal calculus;( belief calculus; and logics.(Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoningMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.(networks( are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the inference algorithm),( learning (using the algorithm),( planning (using networks)( and perception (using Bayesian networks).( Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., Markov models or filters).(A key concept from the science of economics is utility: a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using theory, analysis,( information value theory.( These tools include models such as decision processes,( dynamic networks,( theory and design.( Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (if shiny then diamond) and controllers (if shiny then pick up). Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.(A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and learning approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the neural network,(methods such as the vector machine,(neighbor algorithm,(mixture model,(Bayes classifier,(and decision tree.(The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.( Neural networks File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the brain.The study of neural networks( began in the decade before the field AI research was founded, in the work of Pitts and McCullough. Other important early researchers were Rosenblatt, who invented the perceptron and Werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm.(The main categories of networks are acyclic or neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and neural networks (which allow feedback). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, perceptrons and basis networks.( Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the net, a form of attractor network, which was first described by Hopfield in 1982.( Neural networks can be applied to the problem of control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as learning and learning.(temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex.( Control theory theory, the grandchild of cybernetics, has many important applications, especially in robotics.( Languages AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including Lisp( and Prolog.(Evaluating progress In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the test. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.(Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed matter expert Turing tests. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.(The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are: (1) Optimal: it is not possible to perform better. (2) Strong super-human: performs better than all humans. (3) Super-human: performs better than most humans. (4) Sub-human: performs worse than most humans. For example, performance at draughts is optimal,( performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human (see chess#Computers versus humans) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from complexity and compression.( Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers. Applications File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An online assistant providing customer service on a web page - one of many applications of artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list.  Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the effect.() Competitions and prizes There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, driverless cars, robot soccer and games. Platforms A platform (or platform) is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run. As Rodney Brooks(Brooks, R.A., How to build complete creatures rather than isolated cognitive simulators, in K. VanLehn (ed.), Architectures for Intelligence, pp. 225239, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ, 1991.) pointed out many years ago, it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., we need to be working out AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from systems, albeit PC-based but still an entire real-world system, to various robot platforms such as the widely available Roomba with open interface.(Hacking Roomba  Search Results  atmel) Philosophy Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness? A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below.(;Turings polite convention: If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. Turing theorized that, ultimately, we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on its behavior. This theory forms the basis of the test.(;The Dartmouth proposal: Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.(; Newell and Simons physical symbol system hypothesis: A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action. Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consists of formal operations on symbols.( Dreyfus argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See critique of AI.)(Dreyfus criticized the necessary condition of the symbol system hypothesis, which he called the psychological assumption: The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules. )(; incompleteness theorem: A system (such as a computer program) can not prove all true statements.(This is a paraphrase of the relevant implication of Gdels theorems.) Penrose is among those who claim that Gdels theorem limits what machines can do. (See Emperors New Mind.)(; Searles strong AI hypothesis: The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.( John Searle counters this assertion with his room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be.(; The brain argument: The brain can be simulated. Moravec, Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.( Predictions Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both fiction and projections about the future of technology and society. The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues, and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fears.In fiction, Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles, includinga servant (R2D2 in Wars),a law enforcer (K.I.T.T. Knight Rider),a comrade (Lt. Commander Data in Trek: The Next Generation),a conqueror/overlord (Matrix),a dictator (Folded Hands),a benevolent provider/de facto ruler (Culture),an assassin (Terminator),a sentient race (Battlestar Galactica/Transformers),an extension to human abilities (in the Shell)and the savior of the human race (Daneel Olivaw in the Robot Series).Shelleys Frankenstein considers a key issue in the of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern fiction, including the films I Robot, Runner and Artificial Intelligence, in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions. This issue, now known as rights, is currently being considered by, for example, Californias for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.( The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film & Pray.(http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html Independent documentary Plug & Pray, featuring Joseph Weizenbaum and Raymond Kurzweil)Martin Ford, author of The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future,() and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupationsand in particular entry level jobswill be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning(Machine Learning: A Job Killer?) and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work.(Weizenbaum wrote that AI applications can not, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as service or psychotherapy(In the early 70s, Colby presented a version of Weizenbaums ELIZA known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. ) was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as computationalism). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.(Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Kurzweil has used law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029. He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past, a scenario that fiction writer Vinge named the singularity.(Robot designer Moravec, cyberneticist Warwick and inventor Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.( This idea, called transhumanism, which has roots in Huxley and Ettinger, has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the manga in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.Fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution, an idea first proposed by Samuel Butlers among the Machines (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.(McCorduck writes that all these scenarios are expressions of the ancient human desire to, as she calls it, forge the gods.(See also* intelligence in fiction* Intelligence (journal)* intelligence (video games)* intelligence* sciences* artificial intelligence* of basic artificial intelligence topics* Artificial intelligence researchers* List of important AI publications* List of AI projects* of emerging technologies* of scientific journals* of mind* singularity* Language Learning* Description of Machine Learning field References  Notes ((TOPIO:* * ))(Definition of AI as the study of agents:* , which provides the version that is used in this article.

Alloy
File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|Steel is a metal alloy whose major component is iron, with carbon content between 0.02% and 2.14% by mass.An alloy is a homogeneous mixture or metallic solution composed of two or more elements.(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/alloy) Complete solid solution alloys give single solid phase microstructure, while partial solutions give two or more phases that may or may not be homogeneous in distribution, depending on thermal (heat treatment) history. Alloys usually have different properties from those of the component elements.Alloy constituents are usually measured by mass.TheoryAlloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non-metals that often enhance its properties. For example, steel is stronger than iron, its primary element. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, modulus, and electrical and conductivity, of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as strength(Adelbert Phillo Mills, (1922) Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties, John Wiley & sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison) and strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element occur. For example, impurities in semi-conducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.()()Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was the first alloy discovered, during the prehistoric period now known as the age; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for ornaments, bells, statues, and bearings. Brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc. Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single point, but a melting range in which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases. The temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus, and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus. However, for most alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents (in rare cases two)the eutectic mixturewhich gives the alloy a unique melting point.TerminologyThe term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the base or the matrix. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms, not counting impurities, such as a copper-nickel alloy, then it is called a binary alloy. If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ternary alloy. An alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy, while a five-part alloy is termed a quinary alloy. Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system.(Michael Bauccio (2005) ASM metals reference book, ASM International 2005)When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism. The relative size of each atom in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are replaced with atoms of the other constituent. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, and so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices.(Jon L. Dossett, Howard E. Boyer (2006) Practical heat treating, ASM International, pp. 1-14)Alloys are often made to alter the mechanical properties of the base metal, to induce hardness, toughness, ductility, or other desired properties. While most metals and alloys can be work hardened by inducing defects in their crystal structure, caused by deformation, some alloys can also have their properties altered by treatment. Nearly all metals can be softened by annealing, which repairs the crystal defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of aluminum, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree that steel does.( At a certain temperature, the base metal of steel, iron, undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called allotropy. This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the crystal. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron. If the iron is cooled slowly, the carbon atoms will be forced out of solution, into the spaces between the crystals. If the steel is cooled quickly, the carbon atoms become trapped in solution, causing the iron crystals to deform when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, inducing great hardness.( In practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 karat gold is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the silver used in jewelry and the aluminium used as a structural building material are also alloys.The term alloy is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an alloy are commonly referred to as simply alloy wheels, although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys.HistoryThe use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron, a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was.() Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools, weapons, and nails. In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads. They were often used as anvils. Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable, and difficult for ancient people to work.(Vagn Fabritius Buchwald Iron and steel in ancient times, Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 1322)Iron is usually found as ore on Earth, except for one deposit of iron in Greenland, which was used by the Inuit people.(Vagn Fabritius Buchwald Iron and steel in ancient times, Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 35-37) Native copper, however, was found worldwide, along with silver, gold and platinum, which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since Neolithic times. Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore, and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form bronze, which is much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass.(Vagn Fabritius Buchwald Iron and steel in ancient times, Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 3941) Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as hardness, toughness and point, under various conditions of temperature and hardening, developing much of the information contained in modern alloy constitution diagrams.(The first known smelting of iron began in Anatolia, around 1800 BC. Called the bloomery process, it produced very soft but ductile iron and, by 800 BC, the technology had spread to Europe. iron, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon, was being produced in China as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. These metals found little practical use until the introduction of steel around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of welding, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal.(Cyril Smith  (1960) History of metallography, MIT Press, ISBN 0262691205 pp. 24)Mercury had been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form amalgams (an alloy in a soft paste, or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called gilding, such as armor and mirrors. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind.(George Rapp (2009) Archaeomineralogy, Springer, p. 180 ISBN 3540785930) Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.(Harry A. Miskimin (1977) The economy of later Renaissance Europe, 14601600, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521292085, p. 31)Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient Egypt and Mycenae, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Silver was often found alloyed with gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers.(Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (2000) Ancient Egyptian materials and technology, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521452570 pp. 164167) Around 250 BC, Archimedes was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of Eureka! upon the discovery of principle.(Melvyn Kay (2008) Practical Hydraulics, Taylor and Francis, ISBN 0415351154 p. 45)While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for use in tool and weapon making. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of steel. Huntsmans process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.(George Adam Roberts, George Krauss, Richard Kennedy, Richard L. Kennedy (1998) Tool steels, ASM International, ISBN 0871705990 pp. 23) With the introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.( Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow, such as mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese, which exhibits extreme hardness and toughness.(Cast steel: Austenitic Manganese Steels)See also* of alloys* Intermetallics* treatment* (method)ReferencesExternal links*Surface Alloys*af:Legeringar:be:be-x-old:bs:Legurabg:ca:Aliatgecs:Slitinada:Legeringde:Legierunget:Sulamel:es:Aleacineo:Alojoeu:Aleaziofa:hif:Alloyfr:Alliagegd:Coimheatailtgl:Aliaxeko:hr:Leguraio:Aloyoid:Aloiia:Alligatois:Mlmblanda(metallurgia)he:kk:sw:Aloiht:Alyajmetallicalv:Sakausjumslt:Lydinyslmo:Ligahu:tvzetmk:ml:ms:Pancalogammn:nl:Legeringja:no:Legeringnn:Legeringnrm:Alouaiuz:Qotishmametalimetlicaro:Aliajru:mitllicasimple:Alloysk:Zliatinasl:Zlitinasr:sh:Legurafi:Metalliseossv:Legeringtl:Balahakta:th:tr:Alamuk:ur:kimfiu-vro:Sullamyi:zh-yue:zh:

Augustus
Augustus (;( entry Augustus);(In Latin, Augustus name would be inscribed as IMPERATOR GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS.)23 September 63 BC  19 August AD 14) is considered the first emperor of the Empire, which he ruled alone from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD.(The dates of his rule are contemporary dates; Augustus lived under two calendars, the Roman Republican until 45 BC, and the Julian after 45 BC. Due to departures from Julius Caesars intentions, Augustus restored the Julian calendar in 8 BC, and the correspondence between the Julian calendar and the actual calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8 BC.(Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003: 6701)) Born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, he was adopted posthumously by his great-uncle Gaius Julius Caesar in 44 BC via his last will and testament, and between then and 27 BC was officially named Gaius Julius Caesar. In 27 BC the Senate awarded him the honorific Augustus (the revered one), and thus consequently he was Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus.(Formally Imperator Caesar, Divi filius, Augustus which means Imperator Caesar, Son of the Divus (Divus Julius), Augustus.) Because of the various names he bore, it is common to call him Octavius when referring to events between 63 and 44 BC, Octavian (or Octavianus) when referring to events between 44 and 27 BC, and Augustus when referring to events after 27 BC. In Greek sources, Augustus is known as  (Octavius/Oktabios),  (Caesar/Kaisar),  (Augustus/Augustos), or  (Sebastos), depending on context.The young Octavius came into his inheritance after Caesars assassination in 44 BC. In 43 BC, Octavian joined forces with Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in a dictatorship known as the Triumvirate. As a triumvir, Octavian ruled Rome and many of its provinces.(Some provinces were governed by the Senate.) The triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its rulers: Lepidus was driven into exile, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the of Actium by the fleet of Octavian commanded by Agrippa in 31 BC.After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Octavian restored the outward facade of the Republic, with governmental power vested in the Senate, but in practice retained his autocratic power. It took several years to determine the exact framework by which a formally republican state could be led by a sole ruler; the result became known as the Empire. The emperorship was never an office like the dictatorship which Caesar and Sulla had held before him; indeed, he declined it when the Roman populace entreated him to take on the dictatorship.(Gruen (2005), 35.) By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including those of tribune of the plebs and censor. He was consul until 23 BC.(Dio (1987), 153.) His substantive power stemmed from financial success and resources gained in conquest, the building of patronage relationships throughout the Empire, the loyalty of many military soldiers and veterans, the authority of the many honors granted by the Senate,( and the respect of the people. Augustus control over the majority of Romes legions established an armed threat that could be used against the Senate, allowing him to coerce the Senates decisions. With his ability to eliminate senatorial opposition by means of arms, the Senate became docile towards him. His rule through patronage, military power, and accumulation of the offices of the defunct Republic became the model for all later imperial governments.The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Romana, or Roman peace. Despite continuous wars on the frontiers, and one year-long civil war over the imperial succession, the Mediterranean world remained at peace for more than two centuries. Augustus enlarged the empire dramatically, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Raetia, expanded possessions in Africa, and completed the conquest of Hispania. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the empire with states, and made peace with Parthia through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed networks of roads with an official courier system, established a standing army, established the Guard, and created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome. Much of the city was rebuilt under Augustus; and he wrote a record of his own accomplishments, known as the Gestae Divi Augusti, which has survived. Upon his death in AD 14, Augustus was declared a god by the Senateto be worshipped by the Romans.( His names Augustus and Caesar were adopted by every subsequent emperor; and the sixth month of the Roman calendar, previously named Sextilis, was renamed Augustus (August in English) in his honour. He was succeeded by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law), Tiberius.Early lifeWhile his paternal family was from the town of Velletri, about 25 miles from Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63 BC. He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the Hill, very close to the Forum. He was given the name Gaius Octavius Thurinus, his cognomen possibly commemorating his fathers victory at Thurii over a rebellious band of slaves.(Suetonius, Augustus 7)(56 on-line text.) Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavius was taken to his fathers home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavius only mentions his fathers equestrian family briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather was a military tribune in Sicily during the Punic War. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father, also named Gaius Octavius, had been governor of Macedonia.(Suetonius, Augustus The Marcus Octavius vetoing the law suggested by Gracchus in 133 BC was possibly his ancestor. 14.)(Rowell (1962), 14.) His mother Atia was the niece of Caesar.In 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died.(Chisholm (1981), 23.) His mother married a former governor of Syria, Marcius Philippus.(Suetonius, Augustus 48; of Damascus, Augustus 3. ) Philippus claimed descent from the Great, and was elected consul in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother (and Julius Caesars sister), Julia Caesaris.In 52 or 51 BC, Julia Caesaris died. Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.(Suetonius, Augustus 8.1; Quintilian, 12.6.1.) From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the virilis four years later,(Suetonius, Augustus 8.1) and was elected to the of Pontiffs in 47 BC.(Nicolaus of Damascus, Augustus 4. )(Rowell (1962), 16.) The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the of Venus Genetrix, built by Julius Caesar.( According to of Damascus, Octavius wished to join Caesars staff for his campaign in Africa but gave way when his mother protested.(Nicolaus of Damascus, Augustus 6. ) In 46 BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey, Caesars late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he crossed hostile territory to Caesars camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably.( Velleius Paterculus reports that Caesar afterwards allowed the young man to share his carriage.(Velleius Paterculus 2.59.3.) When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the Virgins, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.(Suetonius, Julius 83.)Rise to powerHeir to CaesarFile:Gerome Death of Caesar.jpg|thumb|300px|The Death of Caesar, by Grme (1867). On 15 March 44 BC, Octaviuss adoptive father Julius Caesar was assassinated by a conspiracy led by Junius Brutus and Cassius Longinus.At the time Caesar was killed on the of March (the 15th) 44 BC, Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in Illyria. Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia, he sailed to Italia to ascertain if he had any potential political fortunes or security.(Eck (2003), 9.) After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, he learned the contents of Caesars will, and only then did he decide to become Caesars political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.(((Appian, Civil Wars 3.911.) Having no living legitimate children,(His daughter Julia had died in 54 BC.) Caesar had adopted his great-nephew Octavius as his son and main heir.(Rowell (1962), 15.) Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncles name, Gaius Julius Caesar. Although Romans who had been adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g. Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.) there is no evidence that he ever bore the name Octavianus, as it would have made his modest origins too obvious.(Mackay (2004), 160.)((Southern, Augustus pp.2021) However, despite the fact that he never officially bore the name Octavianus, to save confusing the dead dictator with his heir, historians often refer to the new Caesarbetween his adoption and his assumption, in 27 BC, of the name Augustusas Octavian.(Southern, Augustus pp.21) Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius, in his work of the Twelve Caesars, describes Antonys accusation as political slander.(Suetonius, Augustus 68, 71.)To make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy, Octavian could not rely on his limited funds.(Eck (2003), 910.) After a warm welcome by Caesars soldiers at Brundisium,( Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against Parthia in the Middle East.( This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.(Rowell (1962), 18.) A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds made no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senates arch enemy, Mark Antony.(Rowell (1962), 19.) Octavian made another bold move in 44 BC when without official permission he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Romes Eastern province to Italy.(Eck (2003), 10.)(Eder (2005), 18.) Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesars veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar.((Appian, Civil Wars 3.1112.) On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavians presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesars former veterans stationed in Campania.( By June he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 denarii.(Chisholm (1981), 24.)(Chisholm (1981), 27.)(Rowell (1962), 20.)Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC,( Octavian found the consul Antony, Caesars former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictators assassins; they had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March, yet Antony succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome.( This was due to his inflammatory eulogy given at Caesars funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.( Although Mark Antony was amassing political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he at first opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.(Eck (2003), 11.) Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesars money to him. However, during the summer he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts to get rid of Antonius.(Syme (1939), 114120.) In September, the Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying Antony as the greatest threat to the order of the Senate.(Chisholm (1981), 26.)(Rowell (1962), 30.) With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws which would lend him control over Gaul, which had been assigned as part of his province, from Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesars assassins.(Eck (2003), 1112.)(Rowell (1962), 21.) Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans, and on 28 November won over two of Antonys legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.(Syme (1939), 123126.)(Eck (2003), 12.)(Rowell (1962), 23.) In the face of Octavians large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome, and to the relief of the Senate he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January.(First conflict with AntonyFile:Bust of augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Augustus in Capitolini, RomeAfter Decimus Brutus refused to give up Gaul, Antony besieged him at Mutina.(Rowell (1962), 24.) The resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the violence were rejected by Antony, as the Senate had no army of its own to challenge him; this provided an opportunity for Octavian, who was already known to have armed forces.( Cicero also defended Octavian against Antonys taunts about Octavians lack of noble lineage; he stated we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth.(Chisholm (1981), 29.)  This was in part a rebuttal to Antonys opinion of Octavian, as Cicero quoted Antony saying to Octavian, You, boy, owe everything to your name.(Chisholm (1981), 30.)(Rowell (1962), 1920.) In this unlikely alliance orchestrated by the arch anti-Caesarian senator Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on  1 January 43 BC, yet he was also given the power to vote alongside the former consuls.(( In addition, Octavian was granted imperium (commanding power), which made his command of troops legal, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43 BC).((Syme (1939), 167.) In April of 43 BC, Antonys forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Gaul. However, both consuls were killed, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.(Syme (1939), 173174)(Scullard (1982), 157.)After heaping many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than  Octavian for defeating Antony, the Senate attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus, yet Octavian decided not to cooperate.(Rowell (1962), 2627.) Instead, Octavian stayed in the Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony.(Rowell (1962), 27.) In July, an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa.(Chisholm (1981), 3233.) Octavian also demanded that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy should be rescinded.( When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions.( He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on  19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative Pedius as co-consul.(Eck (2003), 14.)(Rowell (1962), 28.) Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.(Syme (1939), 176186.)Second TriumvirateProscriptionsFile:Antony with Octavian aureus.jpg|thumb|Roman aurei bearing the portraits of Antony (left) and Octavian (right), issued in 41 BC to celebrate the  establishment of the Triumvirate by Octavian, Antony and Marcus Lepidus in 43 BC. Both sides bear the inscription III VIR R P C, meaning One of Three Men for the Regulation of the Republic.()In a meeting near Bologna in October of 43 BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a junta called the Triumvirate.( This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law passed by the plebs, unlike the unofficial Triumvirate formed by Pompey Magnus, Caesar and Licinius Crassus.(Eck (2003), 15.)(Scullard (1982), 163.) The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which allegedly 300 senators and 2,000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.( The estimation that 300 senators were proscribed was presented by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed.(Southern (1998), 5253.) This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay their troops salaries for the upcoming conflict against Caesars assassins, Junius Brutus and Cassius Longinus.(Scullard (1982), 164.) Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.(Eck (2003), 16.)Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing. However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies.(Scott (1933), 1920.) Velleius Paterculus asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them.( Dio defended Augustus as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.( This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies.(Scott (1933), 20.) Suetonius presents the case that Octavian, although reluctant at first to proscribe officials, nonetheless pursued his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs.( Plutarch describes the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family between Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Julius Caesar IV, and Lepidus his brother Paulus.(Scott (1933), 19.)File:S0484.4.jpg|thumb|left|A denarius minted c. 18 BC. Obverse: CAESAR AVGVSTVS; reverse: DIVVSIVLIVS (DIVINE JULIUS)Battle of Philippi and division of territoryOn 1 January 42 BC, the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, Iulius. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was filius, Son of God.(Syme (1939), 202.) Antony and Octavian then sent 28 legions by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece.(Eck (2003), 17.) After two battles at Philippi in Macedonia in October of 42, the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed suicide. Mark Antony would later use the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antonys forces.(Eck (2003), 1718.) In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to Vipsanius Agrippa instead.(After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. While Antony placed Gaul, the provinces of Hispania, and Italia in the hands of Octavian, Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra VII, the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesars infant son, Caesarion. Lepidus was left with the province of Africa, stymied by Antony who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.(Eck (2003), 18.)  Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius, who could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, also required land.( There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland; Octavian chose the former.(Eck (2003), 1819.)  There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.(Eck (2003), 19.)Rebellion and marriage alliancesWidespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over his soldiers settlements encouraged many to rally at the side of Lucius Antonius, who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate.(  Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from Pulchra, the daughter of Fulvia and her first husband Clodius Pulcher. Claiming that his marriage with Clodia had never been consummated, he returned her to her mother, Mark Antonys wife. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antonys rights against Octavian. However, Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries.( Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at Perusia (modern Perugia), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC.( Lucius and his army were spared due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon.(Rowell (1962), 32.) However, Octavian showed no mercy for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesars assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.(Eck (2003), 20.) Perusia was also pillaged and burned as a warning for others.( This bloody event sullied Octavians reputation and was criticized by many, such as the Augustan poet Propertius.(Pompeius, son of the First Triumvir Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesars victory over his father, was established in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39 BC.(Scullard (1982), 162) Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, who was ironically a member of the republican party, not the Caesarian faction.( Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance when in 40 BC he married Scribonia, a daughter of Scribonius Libo who was a follower of Pompeius as well as his father-in-law.( Scribonia conceived Octavians only natural child, Julia, who was born the same day that he divorced Scribonia to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after his marriage.(While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three children with her.(Helios, Selene II and Ptolemy Philadelphus) Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40 BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. However, this new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit.(Eck (2003) 21.)(Eder (2005), 19.) Meanwhile in Sicyon, Antonys wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvias death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.(( In the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East.( To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40 BC.( During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as Major and Minor).War with PompeiusFile:Denarius Sextus Pompeius-Scilla.jpg|thumb|A denarius of Pompeius, minted for his victory over Octavians fleet. On the obverse the Pharus of Messina, who defeated Octavian. On the reverse, the monster ScyllaSextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying to the peninsula shipments of grain through the Mediterranean; Pompeius own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy.( Pompeius control over the sea prompted him to take on the name Neptuni filius, son of Neptune.(Eck (2003), 22.) A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39 BC with the treaty of Misenum; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and the Peloponnese, and ensured him a future position as consul for  35 BC.(( The territorial agreement amongst the triumvirs and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on  17 January 38 BC.(Eck (2003), 23.) One of Pompeius naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. However Octavian needed Antonys additional support to attack Pompeius, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirates extension for another five-year period beginning in 37 BC.(Scullard (1982), 163)(Eck (2003), 24.) In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Romes defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC.( In an agreement reached at Tarentum, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia.(Eck (2003), 25.) However, Octavian sent only a tenth the number of those promised, which was viewed by Antony as an intentional provocation.(Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36 BC.(Eck (2003), 2526.) Despite setbacks for Octavian, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by general Agrippa at the naval of Naulochus.( Sextus fled with his remaining forces to the east, where he was captured and executed in Miletus by one of Antonys generals the following year.(Eck (2003), 26.)  Both Lepidus and Octavian gathered the surrendered troops of Pompeius, yet Lepidus felt empowered enough to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave.(  However, Lepidus troops deserted him and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and found Octavians promises of money to be enticing.( Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of maximus (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and was effectively exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy.((Scullard (1982), 164) The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. To maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire, Octavian ensured Romes citizens of their rights to property. This time he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy while returning 30,000 slaves to former Roman owners that had previously fled to Pompeius to join his army and navy.(Eck (2003), 2627.)  To ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome, Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister tribunal immunity, or sacrosanctitas.(Eck (2003), 2728.)War with AntonyFile:Lawrence Alma-Tadema- Anthony and Cleopatra.JPG|thumb|Anthony and Cleopatra, by Alma-TademaMeanwhile, Antonys campaign against Parthia turned disastrous, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces.(Eck (2003), 29.) On the other hand, Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength, and since he was already engaged in a romantic affair with her, he decided to send Octavia back to Rome.(Eck (2003), 2930.) Octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an Oriental paramour.(Eck (2003), 30.) In 36 BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end, and that he would step down as triumvir if only Antony would do the same; Antony refused.(Eder (2005), 20.)After Roman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34 BC, Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia; he also awarded the title Queen of Kings to Cleopatra, acts which Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome.( When Octavian became consul once again on  1 January 33 BC, he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antonys grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.(Eck (2003), 31.)  Defecting consuls and senators rushed over to the side of Antony in disbelief of the propaganda (which turned out to be true), yet so did able ministers desert Antony for Octavian in the autumn of 32 BC.(Eck (2003), 3234.) These defectors, Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius, gave Octavian the information he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations he made against Antony.(Eck (2003), 34.) By storming the sanctuary of the Vestal Virgins, Octavian forced their chief priestess to hand over Antonys secret will, which would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, alongside plans to build a tomb in Alexandria for him and his queen to reside upon their deaths.(Eck (2003), 3435)(Eder (2005), 2122.) In late 32 BC, the Senate officially revoked Antonys powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatras regime in Egypt.(Eck (2003), 35.)(Eder (2005), 22.)File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|left|The of Actium, by Lorenzo Castro, painted 1672, National Maritime Museum, LondonIn early 31 BC, while Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece, Octavian gained a preliminary victory when the navy under the command of Agrippa successfully ferried troops across the Sea.(Eck (2003), 37.) While Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatras main force from their supply routes at sea, Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and marched south.( Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antonys army fled to Octavians side daily while Octavians forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.( In a desperate attempt to break free of the naval blockade, Antonys fleet sailed through the bay of Actium on the western coast of Greece. It was there that Antonys fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Sosius in the of Actium on  2 September 31 BC.(Eck (2003), 38.) Antony and his remaining forces were only spared due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatras fleet that had been waiting nearby.(Eck (2003), 3839.) Octavian pursued them, and after another defeat in Alexandria on  1 August 30 BC, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide; Antony fell on his own sword and into Cleopatras arms, while she let a venomous snake bite her.(Eck (2003), 39.) Having exploited his position as Caesars heir to further his own political career, Octavian was only too well aware of the dangers in allowing another to do so and, reportedly commenting that two Caesars are one too many, he ordered CaesarionJulius Caesars son by Cleopatrato be killed, whilst sparing Cleopatras children by Antony, with the exception of Antonys older son.(Green (1990), 697.)(Scullard (1982), 171.)Octavian had previously shown little mercy to military combatants and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.(Octavian becomes AugustusFile:Octavian aureus circa 30 BCE.jpg|thumb|Aureus of Octavian, circa 30 BC, MuseumAfter Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate,(Gruen (2005), 3435.) but would have to achieve this through incremental power gains, courting the Senate and the people, while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, to appear that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy.((  Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.(  Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot.  At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars amongst the Roman generals, and even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the provinces.  Octavians aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections in name at least.(Eck (2003), 4445.)First settlementFile:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustus as a magistrate. The statues marble head was made c. 3020 BC, the body sculpted in the 2nd century AD (Louvre, Paris).In BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies.(  Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing bills for senatorial debate.(Eck (2003), 45.)  Although Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike.(  The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power in the Roman Republic was unrivaled.(  The historian Eck states:The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire.  All of them taken together formed the basis of his auctoritas, which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.(Eck (2003), 113.)To a large extent the public was aware of the vast financial resources Augustus commanded.  When he failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy, he undertook direct responsibility for them in BC.(Eck (2003), 80.)  This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni, the public treasury.(According to H.H. Scullard, however, Augustuss power was based on the exercise of a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised.(Scullard (1982), 211.)The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Romes civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The senates proposal was a ratification of Octavians extra-constitutional power. Through the senate Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.(Eck (2003), 46.)(Scullard (1982), 210.)  The provinces ceded to him, that he might pacify them within the promised ten-year period, comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt.((Gruen (2005), 34.) Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Romes legions.((Eck (2003), 47.)While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure his orders were carried out.( On the other hand, the provinces not under Octavians control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate.( Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power.( The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional producer of grain, as well as Illyria and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions.( However, with control of only five or six legions distributed amongst three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Augustus, the Senates control of these regions did not amount to any political or martial challenge to Octavian.(CCAA, 2425.)( The Senates control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican faade for the autocratic Principate.( Also, Octavians control of entire provinces for the objective of securing peace and creating stability followed Republican-era precedents, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.(File:Augustus Bevilacqua Glyptothek Munich 317.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Augustus, wearing the Crown. Glyptothek, MunichIn January of 27 BC, the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of Augustus and Princeps.(Eck (2003), 50.) Augustus, from the Latin word Augere (meaning to increase), can be translated as the illustrious one.(Eck (2003), 49.) It was a title of religious rather than political authority.( According to Roman religious beliefs, the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanityand in fact naturethat went beyond any constitutional definition of his status. After the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, the change in name would also serve to demarcate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian. His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than Romulus, the previous one he styled for himself in reference to the story of and Remus (founders of Rome), which would symbolize a second founding of Rome.( However, the title of Romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image Octavian tried to avoid.(Eck (2003), 149) Princeps, comes from the Latin phrase primum caput, the first head, originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial roster; in the case of Augustus it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge.(Eck (2003), 3, 149.) Princeps had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, Pompey had held the title.  Augustus also styled himself as Imperator Caesar divi filius, Commander Caesar son of the deified one.( With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, but the use of Imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.( The word Caesar was merely a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family, yet Augustus transformed Caesar into a new family line that began with him.(Augustus was granted the right to hang the civica, the civic crown made from oak, above his door and have laurels drape his doorposts.(Eder (2005), 24.) This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a triumph, with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat mori, or, Remember, you are mortal, to the triumphant general. Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests. Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital. However, Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter, wearing a diadem, or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor Julius Caesar.(Eder (2005), 13.) If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the Curia, bearing the inscription virtus, pietas, clementia, iustitiavalor, piety, clemency, and justice.(Eck (2003), 3.)(Second settlementBy 23 BC, some of the implications of the settlement of 27 BC were becoming apparent. Augustus holding of an annual consulate made his dominance over the Roman political system too obvious, whilst at the same time halving the opportunities for others to achieve what was still purported to be the head of the Roman state.(Wells, pg. 51)  Further, his desire to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn was causing political problems(If the testimony of Primus can be believed, where during his trial for illegally launching a war in Thrace, he asserted that he acted on the orders of Marcellus and Augustus  see Southern, pg. 108 and Eck (2003), pg. 55) and alienating his three biggest supporters  Agrippa, Maecenas and Livia.(Holland, pg. 294)  Feeling pressure from his own core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate in an attempt to bolster his support there, especially with the Republicans; after his choice for co-consul in 23 BC, Terentius Varro Murena died before taking office(Ando, pg. 140; Raaflaub, pg. 426; Wells, pg. 53) he appointed the noted Republican Calpurnius Piso, who had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus.(Davies, pg. 259)In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the Principate in some form,(Southern, pg. 108; Holland, pg. 295) whilst at the same time put in doubt the senators suspicions of his anti-republicanism.(Eder (2005), 25.)(Eck (2003), 56.)  Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa.((  However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed.(( This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.(Gruen (2005), 38.) Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility amongst the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.(Gruen (2005), 3839.)  With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position;(Stern, Gaius, Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus vision of a new world order in 13 BC, pg. 23) nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, it was Augustus intent to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that no matter what the constitutional rules were, they would continue to obey Agrippa.(Holland, pgs. 294-295; Southern, pg. 108)File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Augustus wearing a gorgoneion on a three layered sardonyx cameo, AD 14/20Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his permanent consulship.( The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 BC,((Eder (2005), 26.) both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.(Davies, pg. 259)  Although he had resigned as consul, Augustus retained his consular imperium, leading to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.(Eck (2003), 57.) This was a clever ploy by Augustus; by stepping down as one of two consuls, this allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position, while at the same time Augustus could exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.( Augustus was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position over the Roman provinces remained unchanged as he became a proconsul.((Gruen (2005), 37.) Earlier as a consul he had the power to intervene, when he deemed necessary, with the affairs of provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate.(Eck (2003), 5657.) As a proconsul Augustus did not want this authority of overriding provincial governors to be stripped from him, so imperium proconsulare maius, or power over all the proconsuls was granted to Augustus by the Senate.( The existence of imperium maius is debated by scholars, and it is also argued that he was only granted imperium aequum, or power equal to that of the governors, but his supreme influence allowed him to control the affairs of the provinces.Augustus was also granted the power of a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the official title of tribune.( Legally it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired years ago when adopted by Julius Caesar.(Gruen (2005), 36.) This allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before it, veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, preside over elections, and the right to speak first at any meeting.((Eck (2003), 5758.) Also included in Augustus tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.(Eck (2003), 59.) With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all other attire besides the classic toga while entering the Forum.(Eder (2005), 30.) There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.(Bunson (1994), 80.) Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state, however this position did not extend to the censors ability to hold a census and determine the Senates roster. The office of the tribune plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustus amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship.(Bunson (1994), 427.)File:CaesarAugustusPontiusMaximusCloseup.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Labicana AugustusAugustus as MaximusIn addition to tribunician authority, Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself: all armed forces in the city, formerly under the control of the prefects and consuls, were now under the sole authority of Augustus.(Eck (2003), 60.)  With maius imperium proconsulare, Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph as he was ostensibly the head of every Roman army.(Eck (2003), 61.) In 19 BC, Lucius Cornelius Balbus, governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes, was the first man of provincial origin to receive this award, as well as the last.( For every following Roman victory the credit was given to Augustus, because Romes armies were commanded by the legatus, who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.( Augustus eldest son by marriage to Livia, Tiberius, was the only exception to this rule when he received a triumph for victories in Germania in 7 BC.(Eck (2003), 117.) Ensuring that his status of maius imperium proconsulare was renewed in 13 BC, Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support.(Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class. When Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC, fears arose once again that Augustus was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19 BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.(Dio 54.1, 6, 10.) In 22 BC there was a food shortage in Rome which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis.( After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Romes grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium, and ended the crisis almost immediately.( It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.(Eck (2003), 78.)Nevertheless, the were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio and Lucinius Varro Murena.(Southern, pg. 109; Holland, pg. 299)  In early 22 BC, charges were brought against Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, of waging a war on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, whose king was a Roman ally, without prior approval of the Senate.(Wells, pg. 53)  He was defended by Murena, who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.(Southern, pg. 108)  Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.(Holland, pg. 300)  Under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senates prerogative, as Macedonia was under the Senates jurisdiction, not the Princeps. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.(Southern, pg. 108)  Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustuss policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy  accusations that had already played out during the crisis of 23 BC.(Stern, Gaius, Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus vision of a new world order in 13 BC, pg. 23)The situation was so serious, that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.(Syme, pg. 333)  Murena, disbelieving Augustuss testimony and resentful of his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas, rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.(Syme, pg. 333; Holland, pg. 300; Southern, pg, 108)  Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustuss testimony.(Wells, pg. 53; Raaflaub, pg. 426)  Then, sometime prior to September 1, 22 BC a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio against the Princeps.(Swan, pg. 241; Syme, pg. 483)  Murena was named among the conspirators. Tried in absentia, with Tiberius acting as prosecutor, the jury found the conspirators guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.(Wells, pg. 53; Holland, pg. 301)  Sentenced to death for treason, all the accused were executed as soon as they were captured without ever giving testimony in their defence.(Davies, pg. 260; Holland, pg. 301)  Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.(Holland, pg. 301)In 19 BC, the Senate voted to allow Augustus to wear the consuls insignia in public and before the Senate,( as well as sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces, an emblem of consular authority.(Gruen (2005), 43.)  Like his tribune authority, the granting of consular powers to him was another instance of holding power of offices he did not actually hold.( This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was actually a consul, the importance was that he appeared as one before the people. On 6 March 12 BC, after the death of Lepidus, he additionally took up the position of maximus, the high priest of the collegium of the Pontifices, the most important position in Roman religion.(Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, Res Gestae 10.2. Dio 27.2 reports this under 13 BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).)(Eder (2005), 28.)  On  5 February 2 BC, Augustus was also given the title patriae, or father of the country.(Mackay (2004), 186.)(Eck (2003), 129.)Later Roman Emperors would generally be limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often, to display humility, newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had actually been granted them by the Senate. The civic crown, which later Emperors took to actually wearing, consular insignia, and later the purple robes of a Triumphant general (picta) became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.War and expansionFile:Augusto 30aC - 6dC 55%CS jpg.JPG|thumb|300px|Extent of the Roman Empire under Augustus. The yellow legend represents the extent of the Republic in 31 BC, the shades of green represent gradually conquered territories under the reign of Augustus, and pink areas on the map represent states; however, areas under Roman control shown here were subject to change even during Augustus reign, especially in Germania.Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus chose Imperator, victorious commander to be his first name, since he wanted to make the notion of victory associated with him emphatically clear.(Eck (2003), 93.) By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed imperator as his title after a successful battle.( Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the Res Gestae was devoted to his military victories and honors.( Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet Virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: tu regere imperio populos, Romane, mementoRoman, remember by your strength to rule the Earths peoples!( The impulse for expansionism, apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, is accorded divine sanction by Virgils Jupiter, who in Book 1 of the Aeneid promises Rome imperium sine fine, sovereignty without limit.(Eck (2003), 95.)File:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Tiberius, a successful military commander under Augustus before he was designated as his heir and successorBy the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal),(Eck (2003), 94.) the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia),( Illyricum and Pannonia (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.),( and extended the borders of the Province to the east and south.( After the reign of the client king the Great (734 BC), Judea was added to the province of Syria when Augustus deposed his successor Archelaus.( Like Egypt which had been conquered after the defeat of Antony in 30 BC, Syria was governed not by a proconsul or legate of Augustus, but a high prefect of the equestrian class.( Again, no military effort was needed in 25 BC when Galatia (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after of Galatia was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada.( When the rebellious tribes of Cantabria in modern-day Spain were finally quelled in 19 BC, the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and Lusitania.(Eck (2003), 97.) This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman mining projects, especially the very rich gold deposits at Medulas for example.(Conquering the peoples of the Alps in 16 BC was another important victory for Rome since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Romes enemies in Germania to the north.(Eck (2003), 98.) The poet Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion.(Eck (2003), 9899.) The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12 BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum and his brother Claudius Drusus against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland.(Eck (2003), 99.) Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus forces reached the Elbe River by 9 BC, yet he died shortly after by falling off his horse.( It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brothers body all the way back to Rome.(File:Panormica de Las Mdulas.jpg|thumb|mine of Mdulas.File:TabulaPeutingerianaMuziris.jpg|thumb|right|Muziris in the Kingdom of India, as shown in the Peutingeriana, with depiction of a Temple of Augustus (Templum Augusti), an illustration of relations in the period.To protect Romes eastern territories from the Empire, Augustus relied on the states of the east to act as territorial buffers and areas which could raise their own troops for defense.(Eck (2003), 96.) To ensure security of the Empires eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Romes diplomat to the East.( Tiberius was responsible for restoring Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.( Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with IV of Parthia (372 BC) in 20 BC for the return of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome.(Bunson (1994), 416.)((Brosius (2006), 9697, 136138.) Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus defeat by military means.(Eck (2003), 9596.) However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor (Mars the Avenger) built to house the standards.(Brosius (2006), 97; see also Bivar (1983), 6667.)Although Parthia always posed a threat to Rome in the east, the real battlefront was along the  Rhine and Danube rivers.( Before the final fight with Antony, Octavians campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia was the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube.(Rowell (1962), 13.) Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Romes enemies in Germania.( A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Quinctilius Varus were destroyed with few survivors by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally.(Eck (2003), 101102.) Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany.(Bunson (1994), 417.) The Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated  Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.(Bunson (1994), 31.)Death and successionFile:Augustus Tiberius aureus.png|left|thumb|A Roman aureus struck under Augustus, c. AD 1314; the reverse shows Tiberius riding on a quadriga, celebrating the fifteenth renewal of his tribunal power. At least six potential heirs, including Agrippa and his sons, had expired or proven incapable of succeeding Augustus, before he finally settled on Tiberius in AD 9.The illness of Augustus in 23 BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.( If someone was to succeed his unofficial position of power, they were going to have to earn it through their own publicly proven merits.(Gruen (2005), 50.) Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sisters son Marcellus, who had been quickly married to Augustus daughter the Elder.(Eck (2003), 114115.) Other historians dispute this due to Augustus will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC,(Eck (2003), 115.) instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.( After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Caesar, Caesar, Julia, the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean.(Gruen (2005), 44.)(Eck (2003), 58.)  Although this granting of power would have shown Augustus favor for Agrippa, it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.(Augustus intent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs was apparent when he adopted them as his own children.(Syme (1939), 416417.) He took the consulship in 5 and 2 BC so he could personally usher them into their political careers,(Scullard (1982), 217.) and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.(Syme (1939), 417.) Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livias children from her first marriage, Claudius Drusus Germanicus and Tiberius Claudius, granting them military commands and public office, and seeming to favor Drusus. However, Drusus marriage to Antonia, Augustus niece, was a relationship far too embedded within the family to disturb over succession issues.( After Agrippa died in 12 BC, Livias son Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania and marry Agrippas widow, Augustus daughter Juliaas soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.(Eck (2003), 116.) While Drusus marriage to Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, Vipsania was only the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.(File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|of AugustusTiberius shared in Augustus tribune powers as of 6 BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to Rhodes.((Gruen (2005), 46.) Although no specific reason is known for his departure, it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia.(( It could very well have been from feelings of jealousy and being left out since Augustus young grandchildren-turned-sons, Gaius and Lucius, joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.(Eck (2003), 117118.)(Gruen (2005), 4647.) After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus.(Eck (2003), 119.) This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.( In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustus.(Eck (2003), 119120.) The only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him.( He certainly fell out of Augustus favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character.(Gruen (2005), 49.) Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus.On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting the place of his fathers death at Nola, and Tiberiuswho was present alongside Livia at Augustus deathbedwas named his heir.(Eck (2003), 123.) Augustus famous last words were, Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exitreferring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble. An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.( Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra.(Eck (2003), 124.) Coffin-bound, Augustus body was cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman pantheon.( In 410, during the Sack of Rome, the mausoleum was despoiled by the Goths and his ashes scattered.The historian D.C.A. Shotter states that Augustus policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latters death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.(Shotter (1966), 210212.) Shotter suggests that Augustus deification, coupled with Tiberius extremely conservative attitude towards religion, obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment he might have harbored.(Shotter (1966), 211.) Also, the historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits.( Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her) as well as the two young Caesars Gaius and Lucius, instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.(LegacyAugustus reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate decline of the Western Roman Empire and until the of Constantinople in 1453. Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title Augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at Old Rome and at New Rome. In many languages, caesar became the word for emperor, as in the German Kaiser and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian Tsar. The cult of Divus Augustus continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to Christianity in 391 by I. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the Gestae Divi Augusti, to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum.(Suetonius, Augustus 101.4.) Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.(Eck (2003), 12) The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in Ankara dubbed the Monumentum Ancyranum, called the queen of inscriptions by historian Mommsen.(Eck (2003), 2.) There are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived. This includes his poems Sicily, Epiphanus, and Ajax, an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written rebuttal to Brutus Eulogy of Cato.(Bunson (1994), 47.) However, historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.(Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.)(Bourne (1918), 5366.)Many consider Augustus to be Romes greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empires life span and initiated the celebrated Pax Romana or Pax Augusta. He was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Caesar, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Romes first institutionalized police force, fighting force, and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office.( The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.( A praefectus vigilum, or Prefect of the Watch was put in charge of the vigiles, Romes fire brigade and police.(Bunson (1994), 345.) With Romes civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a army for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.(Eck (2003), 8587.) This was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.(Eck (2003), 86.) With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum.( Besides the advent of swifter communication amongst Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Romes armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.(Chisholm (1981), 122.) In the year 6 Augustus established the aerarium militare, donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.(Bunson (1994), 6.) One of the most lasting institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Guard in 27 BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.(Bunson (1994), 341.) They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Praetoria.(Bunson (1994), 341342.)File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the Kalabsha Temple in NubiaAlthough the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.( He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities.(Eder (2005), 23.) In 28 BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.(The longevity of Augustus reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.(Tacitus, Annals I.3) Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a facto monarchy in these years. Augustus own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperors expense. Augustus ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.( The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.(Kelsall (1976), 120.) However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist Antistius Labeo (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican liberty in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime.(Starr (1952), 5.) In the beginning of his Annals, the Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery.( He continued to say that, with Augustus death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.( Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:According to the second opposing opinion:In a recent biography on Augustus, Anthony Everitt asserts that through the centuries, judgments on Augustus reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that:Tacitus was of the belief that Nerva (r. 9698) successfully mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty.(Starr (1952), 6.) The 3rd century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat.( The poet Annaeus Lucanus (AD 3965) was of the opinion that Caesars victory over Pompey and the fall of the Younger (95 BC46 BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.(The Anglo-Irish writer Swift (16671745), in his Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome, criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed Britains virtuous monarchy to Romes moral Republic of the 2nd century BC.(Kelsall (1976), 118.) In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian Thomas Gordon (16581741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant Cromwell (15991658).( Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher Montesquieu (16891755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.(Kelsall (1976), 119.) In his Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, the Scottish scholar Thomas Blackwell (17011757) deemed Augustus a Machiavellian ruler, a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper, wicked and worthless, a mean spirit, and a tyrant.(Revenue reformsFile:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|Coin of Augustus found at the Pudukottai hoard, from an Tamil country, Kingdom of present day Nadu in India. MuseumAugustus public revenue reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empires expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus predecessors had done.( This reform greatly increased Romes net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.(Eck (2003), 8384.) The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province.(Bunson (1994), 404.) Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.( Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the of kin.(File:AugustusIndianImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|left|Indian imitation of a coin of Augustus. 1st century. MuseumAn equally important reform was the abolition of private farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors that raised taxes had been the norm in the Republican era, and some had grown powerful enough to influence the amount of votes for politicians in Rome.( The tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations, as well as great private wealth, by winning the right to tax local areas.( Romes revenue was the amount of the successful bids, and the tax farmers profits consisted of any additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Romes blessing. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers desire to maximize their profits, had produced a system of arbitrary exactions that was often barbarously cruel to taxpayers, widely (and accurately) perceived as unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.File:HymiariteKingdomAugustusImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Himyarite Kingdom, southern coast of the peninsula. This is also an imitation of a coin of Augustus. 1st centuryThe use of Egypts immense land rents to finance the Empires operations resulted from Augustus conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.(Bunson (1994), 144.) As it was effectively considered Augustus private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperors patrimonium.(Bunson (1994), 144145.) Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard.(Bunson (1994), 145.) The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions,( as well as bread and circuses for the population of Rome.Month of AugustThe month of August (Latin: Augustus) is named after Augustus; until his time it was called Sextilis (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original calendar and the Latin word for six is sex). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Caesars July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see calendar). According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.(Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.35.)Building projectsFile:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the Pacis (Altar of Peace), 13 BC to 9 BCOn his deathbed, Augustus boasted I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble. Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empires strength.(Dio 56.30.3) Marble could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.(  Although this did not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the Martius, with the Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt.(Eck (2003), 122.) The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus triumphs in the Res Gestae.(Bunson (1994), 32.) Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.(  He also built the of Caesar, the of Agrippa, and the of Augustus with its of Mars Ultor. Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippas construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, of Marcellus). Even his of Augustus was built before his death to house members of his family.(Eck (2003), 118121) To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the Arch of Augustus was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the of Castor and Pollux, and widened in 19 BC to include a triple-arch design.( There are also many buildings outside of the city of Rome that bear Augustus name and legacy, such as the Theatre of Merida in modern Spain, the Carre built at Nmes in todays southern France, as well as the of Augustus at Turbie, located near Monaco.Temple of Augustus and Livia in Vienne, late 1st century BCAfter the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Romes water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense.(Eck (2003), 79.) In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Romes aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.( In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum (translated as Supervisors of Public Property) was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.(  Augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum (translated as Supervisors for Roads) for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.(Eck (2003), 81.)The order of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.(Bunson (1994), 34.) Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.(Physical appearanceThe biographer Suetonius describes Augustus outward appearance as follows: He was unusually handsome ... He had clear, bright eyes ... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclining to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature ...(Suetonius, Augustus 79, translated by J. C. Rolfe.)AncestryAncestors of Augustus DescendantsAugustus only child was his daughter.:1.

Andes
The Andes is the worlds longest continental range. It is a continual range of highlands along the western coast of America. This range is about  long, about  to  wide (widest between 18 degrees South and 20 degrees South latitude), and of an average height of about .Along its length, the Andes is split into several ranges, which are  separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes is the location of several high plateaux  some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot, Arequipa, Medelln, Sucre, and Paz.The so-called Altiplano plateau is the worlds second-highest plateau following the plateau. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries; Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.The Andes range is the worlds highest mountain range outside of the continent of Asia. The highest peak, Mt. Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about  above level. The peak of Mt. Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is farther from the centre of the Earth than any other location on the Earths surface. This is because of the bulge that results from the Earths rotation. The worlds highest volcanoes are in the Andes, including del Salado on the Chile-Argentina frontier which rises to 6,893 m (22,615 ft), and over 50 other volcanoes that rise above 6,000 m.NameThe etymology of the word Andes has been debated. The major consensus is that it derives from the Quechua word anti, which means high crest. Others believe that Andes comes from Suyu, one of the four regions of the Inca empire. It is more likely however that the word Antisuyo derives from the use of Anti to designate mountain chains. Derivation from the Spanish andn (in the sense of cultivation terrace) has also been proposed, yet considered very unlikely.Geographythumb|Aerial view of Aconcagua.The Andes can be divided into three sections: I. The Southern Andes in Argentina and Chile;II. The Central Andes, including the Chilean and Peruvian cordilleras and parts of Bolivia;III. The Northern Andes in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador that consists of two parallel ranges, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Oriental. In Colombia, north of its the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, the western, central, and eastern ranges. (The cordillera occidental, central, and oriental).In the northern part of the Andes, the isolated Nevada de Santa Marta range is often considered to be part of the Andes. The eastern range of Colombia is the only one that extends to Venezuela.(Andes travel map) The term cordillera comes from the Spanish word meaning cuerda, meaning rope. The Andes range is about  wide throughout its length, except in the Bolivian flexure where it is about  wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaao, which lie in the Sea off the coast of Venezuela, were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the Andes range, but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the South-American and Caribbean plates.()GeologyThe Andes are a Mesozoic  Tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Ring of Fire, a zone of activity that encompasses the Pacific rim of the Americas as well as the Asia-Pacific region. The Andes are the result of tectonics processes, caused by the subduction of crust beneath the American plate. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of western rim of the American Plate due to the subduction of the Plate and the Plate. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several basins such as Orinoco, Basin, Madre de Dios and Chaco which separates the Andes from the ancient cratons in eastern South America. In the south the Andes shares a long boundary with the former Patagonia Terrane. To the west, the Andes end at the Ocean, although the trench can be considered its ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography.OrogenyThe western rim of the American Plate has been the place of several pre-Andean orogenies since at least the  of the late Proterozoic and early Paleozoic when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern South America, by then the South American part of Gondwana.The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic when Pangea began to break up and several rifts developed. It continued through the Jurassic Period. It was during the Cretaceous Period that the Andes began to take its present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and erosion.Tectonic forces above the zone along the entire west coast of South America where the Plate and a part of the Plate are sliding beneath the American Plate continue to produce an ongoing orogenic event resulting in minor to major earthquakes and eruptions to this day. In the extreme south a major fault separates del Fuego from the small Plate. Across the  wide Passage lie the mountains of the Peninsula south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain.VolcanismImage:Browncanyonquilotoa.jpg|thumb|valley near Quilotoa, Ecuador.thumb|Astronaut photograph with the high plains of the Andes Mountains in the foreground, with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert.The Andes range has many active volcanoes, which are distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity. The Andean volcanism is a result of subduction of the Plate and Plate underneath the American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighboring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for calc-alkalic and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extrensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of ridges and seamount chains apart from a large range on crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.Ore deposits and evaporitesThe Andes mountains host large ore and salt deposits and some of its eastern and thrust belt acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of hydrocarbons. In the forelands of the desert some of the largest copper mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the 1st and 2nd largest exporters of copper in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by hydrothermal fluids (mostly water) during the cooling of plutons or volcanic systems.  The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of water. The dry climate in the central western Andes have also led to the creation of extensive saltpeter deposits which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the salars of Atacama and Uyuni, the first one being the largest source of lithium at present day and the second the worlds largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and Neogene plutonism in Bolivias Cordillera Central created the Bolivian tin belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of Rico de Potos.Climate and hydrologythumb|Central Andesthumb|Astronaut photograph of the Central AndesThe climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on location, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of  in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The line depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 m (14,800&ndash;15,800 ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to 4,800&ndash;5,200 m (15,800&ndash;17,060 ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30S, then descending to  on Aconcagua at 32S,  at 40S,  at 50S, and only  in del Fuego at 55S; from 50S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.()The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones; the Andes and the Andes. Since the Dry Andes extends from the latitudes of Desert to the area of River, precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the ablation area or in the accumulation area.In the high Andes of central Chile and Province glaciers are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to radiation.(Jan-Christoph Otto, Joachim Gtz, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Dario Trombotto, and Lothar Schrott (2010). Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system - Morenas Coloradas valley (Cordon del Plata, Mendoza, Argentina))FloraThe Andean region cuts across several natural and floristc regions due to is large extension from Caribbean Venezuela to cold, windy and wet Horn passing trough hyperarid Desert. Rainforests used to encircle much of the northern Andes but are now greatly diminished, especially in the Choc and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. As a direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. Along with several Valles, they are typically dominated by deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric vegetation, reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Desert.About 30,000 species of plants live in the Andes with roughly half being endemic to the region, surpassing the diversity of any other hotspot.( The small tree pubescens, a source of quinine which is used to treat malaria, is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that originated from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes. The high-altitude Polylepis forests and woodlands are found in the Andean areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees, by locals referred to as Queua, Yagual and other names, can be found at altitudes of  above sea level. It remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the Incan period. Regardless, in modern times the clearance has accelerated, and the trees are now considered to be highly endangered, with some believing that as little as 10% of the original woodland remains.()FaunaImage:Tunki Tanpupata.jpg|thumb|A male Cock-of-the-rock, a species found in humid Andean forests.Image:Ausangate-hillside-MT.jpg|thumb|Herds of alpacas on the mountain Ausangate hillside.The Andes is rich in fauna: With almost 3,500 species, of which roughly 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians.(Tropical Andes - biodiversityhotspots.org)The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of mammals (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (about 1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of reptile (about 45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (about 1/3 endemic).(The Vicua and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are widely kept by locals as animals and for their meat and wool. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, inhabit the Andes alpine regions. The Condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Hemisphere, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the huemul, cougar, foxes in the genus Pseudalopex, and, for birds, certain species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Goose, Coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes),  Rhea, Flicker, Sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches.Titicaca hosts several endemics, among them the highly endangered Flightless Grebe and Water Frog. A few species of hummingbirds, notably some hillstars, can be seen at altitudes above , but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests (forests) growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the Yungas and parts of the Choc, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exists, exceptions being the threatened Tapir, Bear and Woolly Monkey.Birds of humid Andean forests include mountain-toucans, quetzals and the Cock-of-the-rock, while species flocks dominated by tanagers and Furnariids commonly are seen - in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens, tapaculos and antpittas.A number of species such as the Cinclodes and Tit-spinetail  are associated with Polylepis, and consequently also threatened.Human activitythumb|Map showing cultural influence in the Andes.The Andes mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences. A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the civilization and Empire in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through imperialistic militarism as well as careful and meticulous governmental management.(DAltroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003) The government sponsored the construction of aqueducts and roads in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.Devastated by European diseases to which they had no immunity, and civil wars, in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. Huancas, Chachapoyas, Caaris) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by Pizarro. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was Picchu, which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the Quechua and language families. Parish and Barclay Pentland surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.In modern times, the largest Andean cities are Colombia, with a population of about eight million, Paz, Bolivia, and Ecuador.TransportationImage:Carretera transandina.jpg|thumb|Troncal 7 (Highway) in the Venezuelan Andes.Several major cities exist either in the Andes or in the foothills, among which are Bogot and Colombia; Ecuador; Venezuela; Paz, Bolivia; Chile, and Peru. These and most other cities and large towns are now connected with asphalt-paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a four-wheel-drive vehicle.(The rough terrain has historically put the costs of building highways and railroads that cross the Andes out of reach of most neighboring countries, even with modern engineering practices. For example, the main cross over the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the Internacional Los Libertadores, and only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected(). Much of the transportation of passengers is done via airline.For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the of the Pacific between Chile, and the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Argentina out of the war. The Army and Navy defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivias only province on the Pacific Coast, and some land from Peru, also - that was returned to Peru later. Bolivia has been a landlocked country ever since then.However, if Chile had kept some land to  the east, the difficulties in transportation between east and west would have been enormous. There has also been bad blood between Bolivia and Chile ever since 1870, and these two countries have not had diplomatic relations since about 1974.Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in which  vehicles are of little use are still present. Locally, the relatives of the camel, the llama and the alpaca continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times.Agriculturethumb|Photograph of young Peruvian farmers sowing maize and beans.The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practised irrigation techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, terracing has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The potato holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. Maize was also an important crop for these people. However, they were mainly used for the production of the culturally important chicha. Currently, tobacco, cotton and coffee are the main export crops. Coca, despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating tea, and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of cocaine.MiningThe Andes rose to fame for its mineral wealth during the Spanish conquest of South America. Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals the mineralizations of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival. Potos in present-day Bolivia was one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World. de la Plata and Argentina derive their names from the silver of Potos.Currently, mining in the Andes of Chile and Peru place these countries as the 1st and 3rd major producers of copper in the world. The Bolivian Andes produce principally tin although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the economy of 17th century Europe.There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish silver mines in Potos in the 16th century to the vast current copper deposits of Chuquicamata and Escondida in Chile and Toquepala in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are also important.PeaksThis list contains some of the major peaks in the Andes mountain range.

Amber
Wood resin, the source of amberAmber is fossilized tree resin (not sap), which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.( Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as jewelry. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams. (Poinar GO, Poinar R. The quest for life in amber. Basic Books, 1995, ISBN 0201489287, p. 133)History and etymologyThe English word amber derives from the Arabic anbar, via Medieval Latin ambar and Old French ambre. The word originally referred to a precious oil derived from the whale (now called ambergris). The sense was extended to fossil resin circa 1400, and this became the main sense as the use of ambergris waned.() The two substances were confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats; whereas amber is less dense than stone, but too dense to float.(see: Abu Zaid al Hassan from Siraf & Sulaiman the Merchant (851), Silsilat-al-Tawarikh (travels in Asia).) The word ambar was brought to Europe by the Crusaders. In French ambre gris was then distinguished from ambre jaune: ambre gris (gray amber) was ambergris; ambre jaune (yellow amber) was the fossil resin we now call amber.Amber is discussed by Theophrastus, possibly the first historical mention of the material, in the 4th century BC. The Greek name for amber was    (electron) and was connected to the Sun God, one of whose titles was Elector or the Awakener.() The modern terms electricity and electron derive from the Greek word for amber and come from William Gilberts research showing that amber could attract other substances.() The word electron was coined in 1891 by the Irish physicist George Stoney whilst analyzing elementary charges for the first time.()()The presence of insects in amber was noticed by the Elder in his Historia, and led him to theorize correctly that, at some point, amber had to be in a liquid state to cover the bodies of insects. Hence he gave it the expressive name of succinum or gum-stone, a name that is still in use today to describe acid as well as succinite, a term given to a particular type of amber by Dwight Dana (see below under Baltic Amber).Heating amber will soften it and eventually it will burn, which is why in languages the word for amber is a literal translation of burn-Stone (nl. barnsteen, de. Bernstein, the latter of which the Polish word bursztyn derives from). Heated above 200C, amber suffers decomposition, yielding an oil of amber, and leaving a black residue which is known as amber colophony, or amber pitch; when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in oil this forms amber varnish or amber lac. Amber from the Sea has been extensively traded since antiquity and in the main land, from where amber was traded 2000 years ago, the natives called it glaes (referring to its see-through similarity to glass). The Baltic Lithuanian term for amber is Gintaras and Latvian Dzintars. They and the Slavic jantar are thought to originate from Phoenician jainitar (sea-resin). However, while most Slavic languages, such as Russian and Czech, retain the old Slavic word, in the Polish language, despite still being correct, jantar is used very rarely (even considered archaic) and was replaced by the word bursztyn deriving from the German analogue.Composition and formationAmber is heterogeneous in composition, but consists of several resinous bodies more or less soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, associated with an insoluble bituminous substance. Amber is a macromolecule by free polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene.(Manuel Villanueva-Garca, Antonio Martnez-Richa, and Juvencio Robles Assignment of vibrational spectra of labdatriene derivatives and ambers: A combined experimental and density functional theoretical study Arkivoc (EJ-1567C) pp. 449458) These labdanes are diterpenes (C20H32) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization.The average composition of amber leads to the general formula C10H16O.FormationMolecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into copal. Sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber.()Botanical originFossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the Agathis group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus Hymenaea,()while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from Sciadopityaceae family plants that used to live in north Europe.()InclusionsThe abnormal development of resin has been called succinosis. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped on to the ground, so that the material may be useless except for varnish-making, whence the impure amber is called firniss. Enclosures of pyrites may give a bluish color to amber. The so-called black amber is only a kind of jet. Bony amber owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin.In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution X-rays.()Extraction and processing Distribution and mining Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.Historically, the coast around Knigsberg in Prussia was the worlds leading source of amber. About 90% of the worlds extractable amber is still located in the Oblast of Russia on the Baltic Sea (which was previously Knigsberg in Prussia, before World War II).(Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast)Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of blue earth have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.Dominican amber, especially Dominican blue amber, is mined through pitting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.(Wilfred Wichard und Wolfgang Weitschat: Im Bernsteinwald.  Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, 2004, ISBN 3-8067-2551-9)TreatmentThe Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a lathe and polish it with whitening and water or with stone and oil. The final lustre is given by friction with flannel.When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of amberoid or pressed amber. The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure; the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri, as well as by celluloid and even glass. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called true amber.AppearanceAmber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color amber, amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other more uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as cherry amber), green amber, and even amber, which is rare and highly sought after.Much of the most highly-prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as bony amber.Although all amber is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about 100 kg is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.()Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.ClassificationAmber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. Terpenoids, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of isoprene (C5H8) units.( Phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.( The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysisgas chromatographymass spectrometry.( The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.()( There is also a separate classifications of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.Class IThis class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids.( It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilise regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), whilst Ic uses enantio labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, enantio biformenes).()IaIncludes Succinite ( normal Baltic amber) and Glessite.( Have a communic acid base. They also include much succinic acid.(amber yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.()IbLike class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack acid.(IcThis class is mainly based on enantio-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and zanzibaric acids.( Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.(Dominican amber differentiates itself from amber by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of fossil inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.(George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World, (Princeton University Press) ISBN 0-691-02888-5) Resin from the extinct species protera is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not succinite but retinite.(Grimaldi, D. A.: Amber  Window to the Past.  American Museum of Natural History, New York 1996)Class IIThese ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as cadinene.(Class IIIThese ambers are polystyrenes.(Class IVThis class is something of a wastebasket; its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of cedrane-based sesquiterpenoids.(Class VClass V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and n-alkyl compounds. Their type mineral is highgate copalite.()Classification of Baltic amber (succinite) gemstones by the International Amber Association*Natural Baltic amber  gemstone which has undergone mechanical treatment only (for instance: grinding, cutting, turning or polishing) without any change to its natural properties*Modified Baltic amber  gemstone subjected only to thermal or high-pressure treatment, which changed its physical properties, including the degree of transparency and color, or shaped under similar conditions out of one nugget, previously cut to the required size.*Reconstructed (pressed) Baltic amber  gemstone made of Baltic amber pieces pressed in high temperature and under high pressure without additional components.*Bonded Baltic amber  gemstone consisting of two or more parts of natural, modified or reconstructed Baltic amber bonded together with the use of the smallest possible amount of a colorless binding agent necessary to join the pieces.Geological recordThe oldest amber recovered dates to the Upper Carboniferous period ().()() Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers  it is most similar to the resins produced by plants.(There are no flowering plant fossils until the Cretaceous, and they were not common until the Cretaceous.) Amber becomes abundant long afterwards, in the Cretaceous, ,( when it is found in association with insects. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Middle East from Lebanon and Jordan (Kaddumi, 2007; Azar, 2000). This amber is roughly 133 million years old and is considered of high scientific value. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan (Kaddumi, 2007) including the oldest zorapterans, clerid beetles, umenocoleid roaches, and achiliid planthoppers.Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber) is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand, known as blue earth, occurring in the Lower Oligocene strata of Samland in Prussia (Latin: Sambia), in historical sources also referred to as Glaesaria. After 1945 this territory around Knigsberg was turned into Oblast, Russia, where it is now systematically mined.() It appears, however, to have been partly derived from yet earlier Tertiary deposits (Eocene); and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as drift. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern Asia and the southern part of America. Gppert named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests Pinites succiniter, but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called Pinus succinifera. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.Paleontological significanceAmber is a unique preservational mode, preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems and organisms.(BBC  Radio 4  Amber. Db.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.)The chemical composition of the resin is, unfortunately, of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer.(Amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted. Insects, spiders and their webs, annelids, frogs,() crustaceans, bacteria and amoebae,() marine microfossils,() wood, flowers and fruit, hair, feathers and other small organisms have been recovered in ambers dating to .(UseAmber has been used since antiquity in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments, and also in medicine. Amber also forms the flavoring for akvavit liquor. Amber has been used as an ingredient in perfumes.JewelryAmber has been used since the stone age, from 13,000 years ago.( Amber ornaments have been found in Mycenaean tombs and elsewhere across Europe. To this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces.()() Ambers place in culture and tradition lends it a tourism value; Amber Museum is dedicated to the mineral.Historic medicinal usesAmber has long been used in medicine for its purported healing properties. Amber and extracts were used from the time of Hippocrates in ancient Greece for a wide variety of treatments through the Ages and up until the early twentieth century.Scent of amber and amber perfumeryIn ancient China it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, of amber is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with acid to create artificial musk  a resin with a peculiar musky odor.(Amber as an aphrodisiac) Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic pinewood fragrance, modern products, such as perfume, do not normally use actual amber. This is due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as amber are often created and patented(Saturated indane derivatives and processes for producing same, Ernst T. Thermer, p. 1 , , issue date 1972)(Perfume compositions and perfume articles containing one isomer of an octahydrotetramethyl acetonaphthone, John B. Hall, Rumson; James Milton Sanders, Eatontown , Publication Date: 30 December 1975)to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil.(Sorcery of Scent: Amber: A perfume myth. Sorceryofscent.blogspot.com (2008-07-30). Retrieved on 2011-04-23.) The modern name for amber is thought to come from the Arabic word, ambar, meaning ambergris.( Ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of sperm whales and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern. The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and/or labdanum but due to the endangered status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum.() The term amber is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.Amber perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum, resin, copal (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), vanilla, resin and/or synthetic materials.(See also* of types of amber* Ammolite* Copal* of amber* Road* Room* Pearl* coralReferences;Attribution*External links*Farlang many full text historical references on Amber Theophrastus, Frederick Kunz, and special on amber.* IPS Publications on amber inclusions International Paleoentomological Society: Scientific Articles on amber and its inclusions* Webmineral on Amber Physical properties and mineralogical information* Mindat Amber Image and locality information on amber* NY Times 40 million year old extinct bee in Dominican amberaf:Barnsteenar:an:Ambreast:mbaraz:Khrbabe:bs:ilibarbg:ca:Ambrecs:Jantarcy:Ambrda:Ravde:Bernsteinet:Merevaikel:es:mbareo:Sukcenoeu:Anbarfa:fr:Ambregl:mbar()hr:Jantario:Sucinoid:Ambaris:Raf(resina)he:csb:Jantrkk:ku:Karbanla:Sucinumlv:Dzintarslt:Gintarasli:Barnsjt(raza)(svny)my:nah:pozonallinl:Barnsteenja:no:Ravnn:Ravnds:Barnsteenpl:Bursztynpt:mbarro:Chihlimbarru:simple:Ambersk:Jantrsl:Jantarsr:sh:Jantarfi:Meripihkasv:Brnstentl:Amberta:th:tr:Kehribaruk:phchyi:zh:

Acacia
Acacia ( or ) is a genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae, first described in Africa by the Swedish botanist Linnaeus in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian acacias are not. They are pod-bearing, with sap and leaves typically bearing large amounts of tannins and tannins that historically in many species found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.The generic name derives from  (akakia), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician Dioscorides (ca. 40-90) to the medicinal tree A. nilotica in his book Materia Medica.() This name derives from the Greek word for its characteristic thorns,  (akis, thorn).() The species name nilotica was given by Linnaeus from this trees best-known range along the Nile river.Acacias are also known as thorntrees, thorns or wattles, including the yellow-fever acacia and umbrella acacias.The genus Acacia previously contained roughly 1300 species, about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-temperate regions of both hemispheres, including Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and the Americas. However, in 2005 the genus was divided into five separate genera. The name Acacia was retained for the majority of the Australian species and a few in tropical Asia, Madagascar and Islands. Most of the species outside Australia, and a small number of Australian species, were reclassified into Vachellia and Senegalia. The two final genera, Acaciella and Mariosousa, only contain about a dozen species from the Americas each. Classification File:Acacia pycnantha Golden Wattle.jpg|thumb|left|pycnanthaFile:Acacia-berlandieri-flowers4.jpg|thumb|right|berlandieriFile:Acacia smallii 2.jpg|thumb|right|smalliiThe traditional circumscription of the genus Acacia is not monophyletic. This discovery has led to the breaking up of Acacia into five genera as discussed in: of Acacia species. At the 17th Botanical Congress in Vienna, 2005, the much debated re-typification of the genus with an Australian species (which was validated by the 18th IBC in Melbourne, 2011) most of the traditional acacias of Africa are now treated in the genera Vachellia and Senegalia, while some of the American species are placed in Acaciella and Mariosousa. The majority of species still treated in the genus Acacia are confined to Australia.In common parlance, the term acacia is occasionally misapplied to species of the genus Robinia, which also belongs in the pea family. pseudoacacia, an American species locally known as Black Locust, is sometimes called false acacia in cultivation in the Kingdom. Geography The southernmost species in the genus are dealbata (Silver Wattle), longifolia (Coast Wattle or Sydney Golden Wattle), mearnsii (Black Wattle), and melanoxylon (Blackwood), reaching 4330 S in Tasmania, Australia, while caven (Espinillo Negro) reaches nearly as far south in northeastern Province of Argentina. Australian species are usually called wattles, while African and American species tend to be known as acacias.File:Acacia melanoxylon2.jpg|thumb|left|retinodesalbida, tortilis and Acacia iraqensis can be found growing wild in the Sinai desert and the Jordan valley. It is found in the savanna vegetation of the tropical continental climate. It grows wild in Montserrat West Indies; there it is locally referred to as cusha. Description The leaves of acacias are compound pinnate in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and islands species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks (petioles) become vertically flattened, and serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as phyllodes. The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight, as with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light so fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as glaucoptera) lack leaves or phyllodes altogether, but possess instead cladodes, modified leaf-like photosynthetic stems functioning as leaves.File:Acacia dealbata.jpg||thumb|right|dealbataThe small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long stamens, and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, even purple (Acacia purpureapetala) or red (leprosa Scarlet Blaze). Acacia flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, Albizia,  by their stamens which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual Mimosa flowers, those of Acacia have more than 10 stamens.()The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches which have become short, hard and pungent, or sometimes leaf-stipules. armata is the Kangaroo-thorn of Australia and erioloba is the Camelthorn of Africa.Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80 C) and manual seed coat chipping can improve yields to approximately 80 percent.()SymbiosisFile:Acacia collinsii3.jpg|thumb|right|collinsii stipulesIn the American sphaerocephala, cornigera, and collinsii (collectively known as the bullthorn acacias), the large thorn-like stipules are hollow and afford shelter for several species of Pseudomyrmex ants, which feed on a secretion of sap on the leaf-stalk and small, lipid-rich food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets called Beltian bodies. In return, the ants add protection to the plant against herbivores.()  Some species of ants will also fight off competing plants around the acacia, cutting off the offending plants leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing it. Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts.Similar mutualisms with ants occur on Acacia trees in Africa, such as the Thorn acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in the hollow stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants such as mimosae. In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles that damage the plant. Pests In Australia, Acacia species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus including A. ligniveren. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other Lepidoptera larvae which have been recorded feeding on Acacia include Brown-tail, Endoclita malabaricus and Moth. The leaf-mining larvae of some bucculatricid moths also feed on Acacia: Bucculatrix agilis feeds exclusively on horrida and Bucculatrix flexuosa feeds exclusively on nilotica.Acacias contain a number of compounds that defend them from pests and grazing animals.(Chemistry of Acacias from South Texas) Uses  Food uses File:Hauxya Botana.jpg|thumb|Acacia seed pods, also known as Guajes, served as part of a botana in Oaxaca, Mexico.File:AcaciaSeeds.JPG|thumb|Acacia seeds in the Negev, Israel.seeds are often used for food and a variety of other products.In Burma, Laos and Thailand, the feathery shoots of Acacia pennata (common name cha-om,  and su pout ywet in Burmese) are used in soups, curries, omelettes, and stir-fries.In Mexico the seeds are known as Guajes.  Guajes or huajes are the flat, green pods of an acacia tree. The pods are sometimes light green or deep red in colorboth taste the same. Guaje seeds are about the size of a small lima bean and are eaten raw with guacamole, sometimes cooked and made into a sauce. They can also be made into fritters. The ground seeds are used to impart a slightly garlicy flavor to a mole called guaxmole (huaxmole). The dried seeds may be toasted and salted and eaten as a snack referred to as cacalas.The predominantly herbivorous spider kiplingi, which is found in Central America and Mexico, feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves, known as Beltian bodies, which contain high concentrations of protein.  These nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ant, which also eat them.(Meehan, Christopher J.; Olson, Eric J.; Curry, Robert L. (21 August 2008): Exploitation of the PseudomyrmexAcacia mutualism by a predominantly vegetarian jumping spider (Bagheera kiplingi). The 93rd ESA Annual Meeting.)Acacia is listed as an ingredient in Drop, Fresca, a citrus drink, Cola, Barqs beer, Full Throttle Unleaded Drink, Strawberry-Lemonade Powerade(Powerade Ion4 Sports Drink, B Vitamin Enhanced, Strawberry Lemonade | Wegmans) as well as in Lkerol pastille candies, Altoids mints, Langers Pineapple coconut Juice, Wrigleys Eclipse gum and M&Ms Pretzel.Honey labeled under the term Acacia Honey is a type of honey produced by bees from a false acacia known as locust in North America, but called by the misnomer  acacia in Europe, hence this liquid honey which practically doesnt crystallize does not come from true acacias.GumVarious species of acacia yield gum. True arabic is the product of senegal, abundant in dry tropical West Africa from Senegal to northern Nigeria.arabica is the gum-Arabic tree of India, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.File:Acacia covenyi02.jpg||thumb|left|covenyiMedicinal usesMany Acacia species have important uses in traditional medicine. Most of the uses have been shown to have a scientific basis since chemical compounds found in the various species have medicinal effects.In medicine, nilotica is considered a remedy that is helpful for treating ejaculation.A 19th century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an Ethiopian species of Acacia (known as grar) mixed with the root of the tacha, then boiled, as a cure for rabies.(Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), p. 97)An astringent medicine high in tannins, called catechu or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from catechu, by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.(An OCRd version of the US Dispensatory by Remington and Wood, 1918. )Ornamental usesA few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens; the most popular perhaps is dealbata (Silver Wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as mimosa in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus Mimosa.Another ornamental acacia is xanthophloea (Fever Tree).Southern European florists use Acacia baileyana, Acacia dealbata, Acacia pycnantha and Acacia retinodes as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa.(World Wide Wattle)Ornamental species of acacia are also used by homeowners and architects for security. The sharp thorns of some species deter unauthorized persons from entering private properties, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a considerable alternative to artificial fences and walls.PaintsThe ancient Egyptians used Acacia in paints.(Excerpt from A Consumers Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Fifth Edition (Paperback) Amazon.com)PerfumeFile:Acaciafarnesiana1web.jpg|thumb|left|farnesianafarnesiana is used in the perfume industry due to its strong fragrance. The use of Acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries.Symbolism and ritualThe Acacia is used as a symbol in Freemasonry, to represent purity and endurance of the soul, and as funerary symbolism signifying resurrection and immortality. The tree gains its importance from the description of the burial of Abiff, the builder of King Solomons Temple in Jerusalem.Several parts (mainly bark, root and resin) of Acacia are used to make incense for rituals. Acacia is used in incense mainly in India, Nepal, and China including in its Tibet region. Smoke from Acacia bark is thought to keep demons and ghosts away and to put the gods in a good mood. Roots and resin from Acacia are combined with rhododendron, acorus, cytisus, salvia and some other components of incense. Both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit.(Naturheilpraxis Fachforum (German) )According to Eastons Bible Dictionary, the Acacia tree may be the burning bush (Exodus 3:2) which Moses encountered in the desert.(Eastons Bible Dictionary: Bush)  Also, when God gave Moses the instructions for building the Tabernacle, he said to make an ark  and a table of acacia wood (Exodus 25:10 & 23, Standard Version)In Russia, Italy and other countries it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas (among other flowers) on Womens Day (March 8). These mimosas are actually from dealbata (Silver Wattle).TanninFile:Bottle of tannic acid.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of acid.The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in tannin and forms an important article of export; important species include pycnantha (Golden Wattle), decurrens (Tan Wattle), dealbata (Silver Wattle) and mearnsii (Black Wattle).Black Wattle is grown in plantations in Africa. Most Australian acacia species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation. The pods of nilotica (under the name of neb-neb), and of other African species are also rich in tannin and used by tanners.WoodFile:Starr 030405-0092 Acacia koa.jpg||thumb|right|koa WoodFile:Acacia Negev.JPG|thumb|right|Acacia tree near the end of its range in the Negev Desert of southern Israel.Some Acacia species are valuable as timber, such as melanoxylon (Blackwood) from Australia, which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and Acacia omalophylla (Myall Wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. seyal is thought to be the Shittah-tree of the Bible, which supplied shittim-wood. According to the of Exodus, this was used in the construction of the of the Covenant. Acacia koa from the Islands and heterophylla from Runion island are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some Acacia species (e.g. Acacia fumosa), are traditionally used locally as firewoods.()PulpwoodIn Indonesia (mainly in Sumatra) and in Malaysia (mainly in Sarawak) plantations of mangium are being established to supply pulpwood to the paper industry.Acacia gives high opacity and below average bulk paper. This is suitable in lightweight offset papers used for bibles and dictionaries. It is also used in tissue where it improves softness.Land ReclamationAcacia can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage.() Ecological invasion For the same reasons it is favored as an erosion-control plant, with its easy spreading and resilience, some varieties of acacia, are potentially an invasive species.  One of the most globally significant invasive Acacias is Black Wattle mearnsii,  which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread.  Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a high risk, score of 15 rating and it is considered one of the worlds 100 most invasive species.(Acacia mearnsii (PIER species info))Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties as this fast-growing Genus, once introduced, spreads fast and is extremely difficult to eradicate.Phytochemistry of AcaciaAlkaloidsAs mentioned previously, Acacias contain a number of compounds that defend them from pests and grazing animals.( Many of these compounds are psychoactive in humans.The alkaloids found in Acacias include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and N-methyltryptamine (NMT). The plant leaves, stems and/or roots are sometimes made into a brew together with some MAOI-containing plant and consumed orally for healing, ceremonial or religious uses. mythology has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the of life (see the article on the of Osiris and Isis).Cyanogenic glycosidesNineteen different species of Acacia in the Americas contain cyanogenic glycosides, which, if exposed to an enzyme which specifically splits glycosides, can release cyanide (HCN) in the acacia leaves.(Cyanogenic Glycosides in Ant-Acacias of Mexico and Central America David S. Seigler, John E. Ebinger The Southwestern Naturalist, Vol. 32, No. 4 (December 9, 1987), pp. 499-503 doi:10.2307/3671484) This sometimes results in the poisoning death of livestock.If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 mol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia leaves lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.(Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer)Some Acacia species containing cyanogens:* erioloba* Acacia cunninghamii* Acacia obtusifolia* Acacia sieberiana* Acacia sieberiana var. woodii(FAO Kamal M. Ibrahim, The current state of knowledge on Prosopis juliflora... ) Species There are over 1,300 species of Acacia. See of Acacia species for a more complete listing.Famous acaciaPerhaps the most famous acacia is the du Tnr in Niger. The reason for the trees fame is that it used to be the most isolated tree in the world, approximately  from any other tree. The tree was knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.Identification galleryFlowersImage:Acacia aneura blossom.jpg|aneuraImage:Koeh-003.jpg|catechuImage:Acacia baileyana.jpg|baileyanaImage:Acacia berlandieri branch.jpg|berlandieriImage:Acacia confusa-01.jpg|confusaImage:Acacia constricta flower.jpg|constricta, Las Vegas, Nevada, USAImage:Acacia covenyi02.jpg|covenyiImage:Acacia dealbata-1.jpg|dealbataImage:Acacia denticulosa.jpg|denticulosaImage:Acacia_drummodii_fg01.JPG|drummondiiImage:Akazie Blte PA060002 .JPG|erioloba Sossusvlei, NamibiaImage:Acacia fimbriata 02.jpg|fimbriata National Botanic Gardens, CanberraImage:Acacia heterophylla (flowers) 2.JPG|heterophyllaImage:Acacia_longifolia_fg01.JPG|longifoliaImage:Acacia melanoxylon branch.jpg|melanoxylon Nazar, PortugalImage:Acacia saligna(04).jpg|saligna Side, TurkeyImage:Acacia schinoides.JPG|schinoides Australian National Botanic GardensImage:Acacia tetragonophylla.jpg|tetragonophylla Botanic Gardens, Victoria, AustraliaImage:Acacia pennata in Talakona forest, AP W2 IMG 8290.jpg|pennata in Talakona forest, in District of Pradesh, IndiaImage:Acacia pennata in Anantgiri, AP W IMG 8795.jpg|pennata at Hills, in district of Pradesh, India.BarkImage:Acacia-aneura-bark3.jpg|aneura BarkImage:Starr 031013-0028 Acacia auriculiformis.jpg|auriculiformis BarkImage:Acacia-berlandieri-bark.jpg|berlandieri BarkImage:Acacia collinsii1.jpg|collinsii BarkImage:Starr 050107-2872 Acacia confusa.jpg|confusa Bark, Hawaii, USAImage:Yellow Mimosa.jpg|dealbataImage:Acacia-decurrens2.jpg|decurrensImage:Akazie Blte PA060002_.JPG|eriolobaImage:Acacia-estrophiolata-bark2.jpg|estrophiolataBarkImage:Acacia-greggii-bark.jpg|greggii BarkImage:Acacia heterophylla 7.JPG|heterophyllaBarkImage:Acacia pennata trunk in Talakona forest, AP W IMG 8292.jpg|pennata trunk in Talakona forest, in District of Pradesh, India.FoliageImage:Koeh-003.jpg|catechuImage:Acacia collinsii4.jpg|collinsii FoliageImage:Acacia concinna Blanco2.374.png|concinna FoliageImage:Acacia denticulosa.jpg|denticulosa FoliageImage:Acacia karroo1.jpg|karroo FoliageImage:Acacia leprosa1.jpg|leprosa FoliageImage:Acacia pennata leaves in Talakona forest, AP W IMG 8291.jpg|pennata in Talakona forest, in District of Pradesh, India.Image:Acacia pennata in Anantgiri, AP W IMG 8797.jpg|pennata at Hills, in district of Pradesh, India.Seed podsImage:Acacia aneura pods.jpg|aneuraImage:Koeh-003.jpg|catechuImage:Starr_061224-2814_Acacia_confusa.jpg|confusaImage:Acacia constricta pods.jpg|constrictaImage:Acacia dealbata fruto.jpg|dealbataImage:Acacia heterophylla (1).JPG|heterophyllaImage:Acacia verticillata1.jpg|melanoxylonSeedsImage:Acacia baileyana seeds.jpg|baileyanaImage:Acacia berlandieri seeds.jpg|berlandieriImage:Acacia confusa seeds.jpg|confusaImage:Acacia constricta seeds.jpg |constrictaImage:Acacia cyclops seeds.jpg |cyclopsImage:Acacia dealbata seeds.jpg|dealbataImage:Acde 001 lhp.jpg|decurrensImage:Acfa 002 lhp.jpg|farnesianaImage:Acacia greggii seeds.jpg|greggiiImage:Acacia longifolia seeds.jpg|longifoliaImage:Acacia mearnsii seeds.jpg|mearnsiiImage:Acme 001 lhp.jpg|melanoxylonImage:Acacia pycnantha seeds.jpg|pycnanthaImage:Acacia rigidula seeds.jpg|rigidulaImage:Acacia tortuosa seeds.jpg|tortuosaThornsImage:Koeh-003.jpg|catechuImage:Acacia collinsii0.jpg|collinsiiImage:A-cornigera.jpg|cornigeraImage:Acacia-horrida.jpg|horridaImage:Acacia-smallii-thorns.jpg|farnesiana var. farnesianaImage:Acacia pennata in Talakona forest, AP W IMG 8290.jpg|pennata in Talakona forest, in District of Pradesh, India.TreeFile:Mulga.jpg|aneuraImage:Acacia-berlandieri-habit.jpg|berlandieriImage:Starr_050107-2872_Acacia_confusa.jpg|confusaImage:Acacia constricta WPC.jpg|constrictaImage:Acacia dealbata1.jpg|dealbataImage:Acacia heterophylla 1.JPG|heterophyllaFile:Starr 040723-0533 Acacia_koa.jpg|koaImage:Acacia leprosa2.jpg|leprosaWoodImage:Starr_030405-0092_Acacia_koa.jpg|koaImage:PlateauxTamarin2.jpg|heterophyllaImage:Acacia-schaffneri-wood.jpg|schaffneri See also * of Acacia species* defense against herbivory* plants Notes  General references * Clement, B.A., Goff, C.M., Forbes, T.D.A.

Acapulco
footnotes              Acapulco (officially known as Acapulco de Jurez) is a city, municipality and major sea port in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico,  southwest from City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semi-circular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexicos history.()  It is a port of call for shipping and cruising lines running between Panama and Francisco, California, States.() The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo and as well, Mexicos largest beach and balneario resorted city.()The city is best known as one of Mexicos oldest and most well-known beach resorts, which came into prominence by the 1950s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires.()  Acapulco is still famous for its nightlife and still attracts many vacationers, although most are now from Mexico itself.()() The resort area is divided into two: The north end of the bay is the traditional area, where the famous in the mid 20th century vacationed and the south end is dominated by newer luxury high rise hotels.()The name Acapulco comes from Nahuatl language Aca-pl-co, and means At the big reeds ()  or At the broken reeds.  de Jurez was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Jurez, the former of Mexico. The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane.(HistoryBy the eighth century, there was a small culture in the Acapulco area, which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period. In Acapulco bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarrn. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers. Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta and Tambuco.(In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs.  Acapulco formally became part of the Empire in 1486 during the reign of Ahuizotl. It was part of a tributary province called Tepecuacuilco, but control here was relatively unorganized.(There are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Conquest, Corts sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cern was authorized by Corts to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on 13 December 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.(The first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hernn Corts was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.(Corts established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqus, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an alcadia (major province or town).(Spanish trade in the East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of Spain. Galleons started arriving here from Asia by 1550, and in that year  thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents.( Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Galleon, which was the nexus of all kinds on communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.(File:Carl Saltzmann - View of Acapulco, 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|View of Acapulco, 1879, oil painting by SaltzmannThe Galleon would make its yearly run from the mid 16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates,  such as  Drake, Morgan and Cavendish, who called it The Black Ship.(( To protect the port and the cargo of ships coming here the San Diego Fort was built. Despite the forts existence, a Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town and fort before being driven off. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt in 1783.((At the beginning of the 19th Century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, soon after the War of Independence began.  In 1810, Mara Morelos y Pavn attacked and burnt down the city,( after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Pars at the Battle of Tres Palos.( The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.(Acapulcos importance as a port recovered during the Gold Rush in the mid 19th century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here.(In 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.(In 1920, the of Wales and future King Edward VIII visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an East Texas businessman named Albert B.Pullen from Corrigan, Tx. in the area now known as Old Acapulco.( But some of Acapulcos best known hotels were built by others.  In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador,(Portal de Acapulco - Acapulco y su Arquitectura) with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Shoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Al Polin built the Las Americas Hotel.(In the mid 1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses has been built.( In the early 1950s President Alemn Valds upgraded the ports infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.(The economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaires Hollywood stars such as Taylor, Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Bardot.( Former Swing Musician Stauffer, so called Mister Acapulco, was a hotelowner (Villa Vera, Casablanca), who attracted a lot of celebrities to Acapulco.(Teddy Stauffer: Der Swingknig im Paradies - STOCKPRESS.de | STOCKPRESS.de)From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s,( by the early 1960s Acapulco had a population of about 50,000.(World Book Encyclopedia, 1967 Edition, Vol. 1, p. 19) In 1958, The Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pius XII. It would become an archdiocese in 1983.()During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco, the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here.( However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur.()In the 70s there was a significant expansion of the port.(During the 1990s, the road known as the Ruta del Sol was built, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey only takes about three and a half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants.( The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.(The city was devastated by Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns that surround the city, built on steep hillsides. Other victims were swept away by thirty foot waves and  winds. The main road, Avenida Costera became a fast-moving three foot river of sludge.()In the 2000s, the drug war in Mexico has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006. A major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers.(() This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back.( However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before.() The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel. () Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010 and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011.  Among the first incidents dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor.(Mexico: Guerrero narco-violence breaks grisly record | World War 4 Report) In the second incident the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Senderos shopping center.() On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the citys main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces. ()Geography and climateForty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain. Another forty percent is semi flat, and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to . The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas and Alto Camarn. There is one major river, the Papagayo, which runs through the municipality, along with a number of arroyos. There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca. along with a number of thermal springs.Acapulco features a wet and dry climate. The climate here is hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, more even temperatures between seasons than resorts further north in Mexico, but this vary depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical Storms and Hurricanes are threat from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna mostly consists of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of birds of both land and sea as well as marine animals such as turtles.(dateAugust 2010EconomyTourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy three percent of the municipalitys population is involved in commerce and most of this is related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employs less than twenty percent and only about five percent are dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is mostly limited to bottling, milk products, cement products, ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers and melons.(TourismAcapulco is one of Mexicos oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale.() But nowadays, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with local corrupt police who steal money by extortion, and intimidate visitors with threats to jail.()()() The original Acapulco, where hotels owned by personalities such as Weismuller and Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. This is where the boardwalk and main square are and today the area is filled with modern, Mexican style hotels, with discothques and restaurants in walking distance.( This side of the bay is also known as Tradicional or Nautica.The south end of the bay holds the newer constructions, including the high rise hotels. This area includes Punta Diamante, Puerto Marqus, and stretches from the airport to the Papagayo River which separates it from the older section of town. In this area, no one walks as almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.(( The older section of town now mostly caters to middle class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to international visitors and the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.(( This area also has the higher hotel occupancy rates.((Acapulcos reputation is that of a high-energy party town, where one can have dinner at midnight, dance until dawn then relax in the daytime on the beach crowded with sexy bodies in bikinis. The nightlife has made this place famous for decades.( From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the Queen Victoria, the Rotterdam, Harmony as well as all the Princess liner ships.( Despite its international fame, most of Acapulcos visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City.((Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Star Cruises.(Ocean Star Cruises - Acapulco, Retrieved 05 August 2011.)For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals adding 785 million pesos to the economy.  Eighty percent arrive by land and 18 percent by air.()  The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners.( Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and wealthy, such as Miguel, Plcido Domingo and Olmedo, who maintain homes here.(While much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass resort, eclipsed by the newer Cancn and San Lucas.( Over the years a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches such as Tamarindos, who offer everything from newspapers to massages are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach but the government says is difficult to eradicate as there is a lot of unemployment and poor here.()  Around the city are many shantytowns that cling onto the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. Prostitution is also common here as well.( In the last decade, drug related violence has caused problems for the tourism trade here.(Another problem is garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash that is cleaned up during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.()AttractionsAcapulcos main attraction is its nightlife, and has been for many decades.(()  Nightclubs change names and owners frequently. Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is also a jump in this area as well.File:Cliffdivers in La Quebrada, Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|Quebrada Cliff Divers.Another enigmatic attraction at Acapulco are the Quebrada Cliff Divers.( The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive.()  Today the divers are professionals,( diving from heights of forty meters into an inlet that is only seven meters wide and four meters deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe.( On 12 December, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives ranges from the simple to the complicated and end with the Ocean of Fire when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for.( The spectacle can be seen from a public area, which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.()There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarrn, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqus there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.()In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, a small zoo and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers that died here. Many of the scuba diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations.() Another popular activity is deep sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything the trip is free.((In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Zcalo with shade trees and lined with cafes and shops. At the north end of the Nuestra Seora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but when was later adapted into a church.( Acapulcos most historic building is the San Diego Fort, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks.( The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid 17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements.()()  Today the fort serves as the Museo Histrico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the ports history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are also temporary exhibits as well.(The Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantial or CICI is a sea life and aquatic  park located on Costera Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children.(( Another place popular with children is the Parque Papagayo which is a large family park which has life-sized replicas of a Spanish galleon and the space shuttle Columbia, three artificial lakes, aviary, skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.(The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals are able to be seen by the public.(There is a small museum called Casa de la Mscara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and are divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes and Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.(The Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pacifico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many are in danger of extinction, such as the mexicana or purple stick tree.(The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and gourmet food fair. The Cinpolis Galeras Diana and the Teatro Juan Ruz de Alarcn show French and French literary figures give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs will feature French DJs.()  Other festivals celebrated here include  Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May and a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China in November.(There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqus course, the latter designed by Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center.  The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.(Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.(Spring breakOver 100,000 American teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico over break each year.() The main reason students head to Mexico is the 18 year old drinking age (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Beach, Florida have become restrictive on drinking and other behaviors. This has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.()In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cancn had been favored at the spring break destination of choice. However, Cancun has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This has led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that the flight is longer and more expensive than to Cancun for many travelers. Many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulcos famous nightlife.() In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, mostly due to the economic situation in the United States,() and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.() MTV will transmit special programming from Acapulco in 2010.()In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco.(http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_3028.html ) The warninga result of violent activity springing from Mexicos drug cartel debacletook college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break.  The New York Times tracked the travels of another Penn student on spring break in Acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email, while Bill OReilly devoted a segment of his show, OReilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco.()  In June 2009 a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets involving large-caliber weapons and grenades.()  However, no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported.TransportationFrom the U.S., many airlines now fly to Acapulco Airport year-round. While in the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized Colectivo cab system. These cabs cost 10 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first come first served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs mainly travel to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, which is where most of the hotels for visitors are, but also includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly up to his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.The bus system is highly complex, and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form other than walking in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco! painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decaling and home made interior designs that range from book scenes, to adult themes, and even to Kitty themes.GovernmentAs the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities,( which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km2.( This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada), San Marcos, de Bentez with the Pacific Ocean to the south.The metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Jurez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population (as of 2005) of 786,830.()See also* (municipality)* goldReferences External links * Official city website* Acapulco Then and Now  slideshow by magazinezh-min-nan:Acapulcobe-x-old:bg:ca:Acapulcocs:Acapulcocy:Acapulcoda:Acapulcode:Acapulcoet:Acapulcode Jurezeo:Akapulkoeu:Acapulcofr:Acapulcogl:Acapulcoko:hr:Acapulcoid:Acapulcoit:Acapulcohe:kl:Acapulcoka:Guerreromrj:lt:Akapulkaslmo:Acapulcohu:Acapulcoml:nah:caplco(Guerrero)ja:no:Acapulconn:Acapulcopms:Acapulcopl:Acapulcopt:AcapulcoGuerreroru:simple:Acapulcosk:Acapulcosl:Acapulcosr:sh:Acapulcofi:Acapulcosv:Acapulcotl:Acapulcotr:Acapulcouk:vo:Acapulcowar:Acapulcozh:

Australian_Labor_Party
workThe Australian Labor Party (ALP; sometimes simply Labor) is an Australian political party. It has been the governing party of the Commonwealth of Australia since the 2007 federal election. Gillard is the partys federal parliamentary leader and Minister of Australia. Labor also currently governs in Queensland, Australia, Tasmania, Territory and the Capital Territory.Founded in 1891 by the emerging labour movement in Australia, Labor is the countrys longest running political party. Labor contested state seats from 1891 and federal seats following the Federation at the 1901 federal election. Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian Parliament, at the 1910 federal election. The ALP predates both the British Labour Party and Zealand Labour Party, among others, in both party formation and government. The party competes against the Liberal/National Coalition for political office at the federal and state (and sometimes local) level.HistoryFile:Julia Gillard 2010.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Prime Minister Gillard, Leader of the Australian Labor Party since 24 June 2010File:ChrisWatsonSepia.jpg|thumb|100px|Watson, first leader of then Federal Labour Party 190107 (held the balance of power) and Prime Minister of Australia in 1904File:Andrewfisher.JPG|thumb|100px| Fisher, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 190809, 191013, 191415File:Nla.ms-ms1538-10-582-e.jpg|thumb|100px|Hughes, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 191516File:JamesSc.JPG|thumb|100px|Scullin, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 192932File:Johncurtin.jpg|thumb|100px|Curtin, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 194145File:BenChifley2.jpg|thumb|100px|Chifley, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 194549File:Whitlam1955.jpg|thumb|100px|Whitlam, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 197275File:BobHawke(cropped).jpg|thumb|100px|Hawke, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 198391File:Paul Keating - 2007-crop.jpg|thumb|100px|Keating, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 199196File:Kevin Rudd headshot.jpg|thumb|100px|Rudd, Labor Prime Minister of Australia 200710ALP mythology says the first party branch was founded at a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree (the Tree of Knowledge) in Queensland in 1891. The New South Wales branch of the party also claims to be the oldest in Australia. The party as a serious electoral force dates from 1891 in New South Wales, 1893 in Queensland and South Australia, and later in the other colonies. In New South Wales in 1891, the first election contested by Labour candidates (as Labor was spelt at the time  see Etymology), 35 of 141 seats were won by Labour candidates.(Page 4, So Monstrous a Travesty, Ross McMullen. Scribe Publications 2004.) In 1899, Dawson formed a minority Labour government in Queensland, the first in the world, which lasted one week.Sections of state Labour and the labour movement were mixed in their support for the of Australia. Some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming the Senate as proposed was much too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist Colonial upper houses and the British House of Lords. They feared federation would distract attention from the need of social and industrial reform, and further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The first Labour leader and Prime Minister, Watson, was a supporter of federation but not its implementation.After Federation, the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party (informally known as the Caucus) first met on 8 May 1901 at House, Melbourne, the meeting place of the first Federal Parliament.(Faulkner; Macintyre (2001) p. 3) This is now taken as the founding date of the federal Labor Party, but it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level.The ALP during its early years was distinguished by its rapid growth and success at a national level, first forming a government under Watson, the first Labour Prime Minister in the world, for four months in 1904. Fisher then formed another minority government 190809. At the 1910 federal election, Fisher and Labour became Australias first federal government, held Australias first Senate majority, was the worlds first labour party majority government, the first time a Labour Party had controlled any house of a legislature, and the first time it controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature.() The state branches were also successful, except in Victoria, where the strength of Deakinite liberalism inhibited the partys growth. The state branches formed their first majority governments in South Wales and Australia in 1910, in Australia in 1911, and in Queensland in 1915. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years. One of the partys early innovations was the establishment of a federal arbitration system for the resolution of industrial disputes, which formed the basis of the industrial relations system for many decades.Through its membership of the International, the ALP is affiliated with democratic socialist, social-democratic and labour parties in many countries. The party was historically committed to socialist economic policies, but this term was never clearly defined, and no Labor government ever attempted to implement socialism in any serious sense. Labor supported national wage fixing and a strong welfare system, it did not nationalise private enterprise. The single exception to this was Chifleys attempt to nationalise the private banks in the 1940s, but this was ruled unconstitutional by the Court of Australia.(Faulkner; Macintyre (2001) p. 87) The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by Whitlam.From its formation until the 1950s Labor and its affiliated unions were the strongest defenders of the Australia Policy, which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about racial purity (shared by most Australians at this time), and partly by fears of economic competition from low-wage labour. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after War II, when the Government launched a major immigration program. The partys opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of Calwell as leader in 1967. Subsequently Labor has become an advocate of multiculturalism, although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.During War II, Labor leader Curtin became Prime Minister of Australia in 1941 when independents the floor to bring down the Australia Party-Country Party Coalition Government, just weeks before the of Singapore. The Government thus led Australia through the years of the War during which Australia came under attack from the of Japan. Though a monarchist and supporter of the Empire, in December 1941, Curtin announced that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom, thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as ANZUS by the Government). Remembered as a strong war time leader, Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by Chifley.(http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/) The Government won the 1946 election and oversaw Australias initial transition to a peacetime economy. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifley sought to define the labour movement as having:source()To a large extent, Chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions. With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election to Menzies Liberal-National Coalition.(Ben Chifley - Australias PMs - Australias Prime Ministers) The newly formed Party of Australia won 55 seats and the Country Party 19 in the House of Representatives to Labors 47 seats and Labor commenced a 23-year period in opposition.(http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/elections.aspx)Whitlam led the Federal Labor Party back to office in 1972. The Government lost office following the Australian constitutional crisis and Dismissal, and was defeated in a landslide at the resulting 1975 Australian Federal Election. Hawke led Labor back to office in 1983 and the Government remained in power until defeated by Howard at the 1996 election. Beazley led the party to the two subsequent elections as Opposition Leader and Latham to the 2004 election. Beazley was recalled to replace Latham in 2005 and Latham split from his party with the publication of a 2005 memoir Latham Diaries. Beazley in turn was challenged by Rudd who went on to defeat John Howard at the 2007 election. The Government concluded prior to the 2010 election following the replacement of Rudd as leader of the Party by deputy leader Gillard. The Government was commissioned to govern in a parliament following the 2010 election.Between the 2007 federal election and the 2008 Western Australian state election, the party was in government nationally, as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures. This was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the ACT and the NT gained self-government.(In 19691970, before the ACT and NT achieved self-government, the Liberal and National Coalition was also in power federally and in all six states. University of WA elections database) The party subsequently lost power in Victoria in 2010 and suffered its worst electoral defeat in decades in the New South Wales State Election.()EtymologyThe ALP adopted the formal name Australian Labour Party in 1908, but changed the spelling to Labor in 1912. While it is standard practice in English both today and at the time to spell the word labour with a u, the party was influenced by the United States labour movement and a prominent figure in the early history of the party, the Americanborn OMalley, was successful in having the spelling modernised.() The change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the movement in general.(Clarke, FG, Australia: A Concise Political and Social History (Sydney: Harcourt Brace & Company 1996), p 205) Furthermore, the spelling labor had been acceptable in both British and Australian English in earlier periods. (See also: Spelling in Australian English)Labor splitsThe Labor Party has suffered three major splits:* In 1916 over the issue of conscription during the First World War.(Hughes, William Morris (Billy) (18621952), Dictionary of Biography, ANU web site) Labor Prime Minister Hughes supported the introduction of conscription, while the majority of his colleagues in the ALP and trade union movement opposed it. After failing to gain majority support for conscription in two national plebiscites which bitterly divided the country in the process, Hughes and his followers were expelled from the Labor Party. He first formed the Labor Party before forming the Party of Australia in alliance with the conservatives and remained Prime Minister until 1923. At the state level Holman, also a supporter of conscription, quit the party at the same time and became Nationalist Party of New South Wales.* In 1931 over economic issues revolving around how best to handle the Depression. The ALP was essentially split three ways, between those who believed in radical policies such as NSW Premier Jack Lang, who wanted to repudiate Australias debt to British bondholders; proto-Keynesians such as federal Treasurer Theodore; and believers in orthodox finance such as Prime Minister Scullin and a senior minister in his government, Lyons. In 1931 Lyons left the party and joined the conservatives, forming the Australia Party as successors to the Nationalists and becoming Prime Minister in 1932.* The 1955 split on communism. During the 1950s the issue of communism and support for communist causes or governments caused great internal conflict in the Labor party and the trade union movement in general. From 1945 onward, staunchly anti-Communist Roman Catholic members (Catholics being an important traditional support base) in opposition to communist infiltration of unions, formed Groups to gain control of them, fostering intense internal conflict. After Labors loss of the 1954 election, federal leader Dr H.V. Evatt issued a statement attacking the Victorian ALP state executive.() He blamed subversive activities of the Groupers for the defeat. After bitter public dispute many Groupers were expelled from the ALP and formed the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) whose intellectual leader was Santamaria. The DLP was heavily influenced by social teaching and had the support of the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Mannix. Because of its veto with a view to reunification strategy, the DLPs preferences (see electoral system) helped the Party of Australia remain in power for over two decades, but it was successfully undermined by the Whitlam Labor Government during the 1970s, so that after 1978 the DLP was reduced to a small rump based in Victoria, which nevertheless continued to contest federal elections as the DLP (according to the parliamentary library election results for 1980 and onward).()In addition, founding member Cook left the party in 1894, and went on to be Minister of Australia with the Liberal Party in 191314.PolicyThe policy of the Australian Labor Party is contained in its National Platform, which is approved by delegates to Labors National Conference, held every three years. According to the Labor Partys website, The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government.()The platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that Labors traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely. While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: Labor believes in a strong role for national government  the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote. Labor will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions. The Platform and Labor believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential. For Labor, government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status. Further sections of the Platform stress Labors support for Equality and Human Rights, Labour Rights and Democracy.In practice, the Platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labors federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leaders policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the Platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the Platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the Platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the Platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the partys parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the Platform, Labor governments have sought to change the Platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the Platform.Early ideologyThe Labor Party is commonly described as a social democratic party, but its constitution stipulates that it is a democratic socialist party.( ) light on the hill is a phrase used to describe the objective of the Australian Labor Party. The phrase was coined in a 1949 conference speech by then Prime Minister Chifley. The party was created by, and has always been influenced to some extent by trade unionists, and its policy at any given time has been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labors platform called for a White Australia (a view held by all federal MPs at the time bar Bruce Smith, a Free Trader), a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.(McKinlay (1981) p. 19) Labor has at various times supported high tariffs and low tariffs, conscription and pacifism, Australia and multiculturalism, nationalisation and privatisation, isolationism and internationalism, as has the conservative side of Australian politics.In the aftermath of War I and the Revolution of 1917, support for socialism grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange. As a result, Labors Federal Conference in 1922 adopted a similarly worded socialist objective, which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the Blackburn amendment, which said that socialisation was desirable only when was necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.(McKinlay (1981) p. 53) In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry (Chifleys bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the High Court to be unconstitutional.However, the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. Analysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals a band of unhappy amateurs, made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, an MD, and even a mine owner. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies  in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders. Some historically declare the party a mix of socialism, liberalism, pragmatism and Laborism.() These commitments are deemed to place Labor closer, intellectually and historically, to the 19th century colonial liberals as the forerunners to the Labor party over the conservatives of the time.()Modern LaborVarious ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under Whitlam, resulting in what is now known as the Socialist Left who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more socially progressive ideals, and Right, the now dominant faction that tends to be more economically liberal and focus to a lesser extent on social issues.The Whitlam government was the first Australian government to use the term rationalism.() The Whitlam Labor government from 1972 to 1975 was different to previous Labor governments, in that it pursued social-democratic policies rather than democratic socialist policies, a precursor to the partys current third way position. Under the Whitlam government, tariffs across the board were cut by 25 percent after 23 years of Labor being in opposition.()The Hawke and Keating governments from 1983 to 1996 pursued many economic policies associated with rationalism and the Third Way, such as floating the Dollar in 1983, reductions in trade tariffs, taxation reforms, changing from centralised wage-fixing to enterprise bargaining, the privatisation of Qantas and Bank, and deregulating the banking system. Keating also proposed a GST in 1985, however due to its unpopularity amongst Labor as well as the electorate, was not adopted. The party also refrained from other reforms, such as wholesale labour market deregulation (e.g. WorkChoices), the eventual GST, the privatisation of Telstra and reform including for the dole, which Howard and the Party of Australia were to initiate after winning office in 1996.It is also said by a former staff member of Blair that New Labour and Blair learnt from the Hawke government in the 1980s on how to govern when they took power in the UK.()Former Labor leader Rudds first speech to parliament in 1998 stated: Competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all.We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challengethe creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the `third way. The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nations economic and social imperatives.() Rudd is critical of free market economists such as Hayek,( )() although Rudd describes himself as basically a conservative when it comes to questions of public financial management, pointing to his slashing of public service jobs as a Queensland governmental advisor.()()StructureThe Australian Labor Party is a democratic and federal party, which consists of both individual members and trade unions, who between them decide the partys policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office. The majority of trade unions in Australia are affiliated to the party, and their affiliation fees, based on the size of their memberships, makes up a large part of the partys income. The party consists of six state and two territory branches, each of which consists of local branches which any Australian resident can join, plus affiliated trade unions. Individual members pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income. Members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members only become active during election campaigns. The party has about 50,000 individual members, although this figure tends to fluctuate along with the partys electoral fortunes.The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.The party holds a National Conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the National Conference). The National Conference approves the partys Platform and policies, elects the National Executive, and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is Wright. The most recent National Conference was held from 30 July 2009 to 1 August 2009. The next National Conference is scheduled for early December 2011. It was brought forward six months in order to have a debate on gay marriage well ahead of the next election.(http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/doughty-defender-to-tackle-labors-white-bread-ways-20110410-1d97j.html, Sydney Morning Herald, 11 April 2011)(ALP Right rejects proposal, Brisbane Times, 20 November 2010)The national Leader of the Labor Party is elected by the Labor members of the national Parliament (the Caucus), not by the conference. Until recently the national conference elected the partys National President, a largely honorary position, but since 2003 the position has rotated amongst a presidential team of three, directly elected by the partys individual members. Each member of the team serves a one-year term as National President, with the other members serving as Vice-Presidents.(Bligh joins ALP national president team, The Age, 30 March 2009.) The current National President is McAllister,(Welcome to New ALP National President, Australian Labor Party, 6 July 2011.) the National Vice-Presidents are Michael Williamson (President from July 2009 to July 2010) and Bligh (President from July 2010 to July 2011).The Labor Party contests national, state and territory elections. In some states it also contests local government elections: in others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called pre-selection. Candidates are pre-selected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two. Labor candidates are required to sign a pledge that if elected they will always vote in Parliament in accordance with the Platform and decisions made by a vote of the Caucus. They are also sometimes required to donate a portion of their salary to the party, although this practice has declined with the introduction of public funding for political parties.FactionsThe Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which some party members belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are Unity (on the right) and the Socialist Left. Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US Alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The National Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US Alliance and is often more progressive on social issues. The factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, and there is a constantly changing pattern of factional and sub-factional alliances around particular policy issues or around particular pre-selection disputes. Frequently these alliances and disputes reflect power struggles between or within trade unions.The trade unions are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right are the Workers Union (AWU), the Union of Workers (NUW) and the Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). Important unions supporting the left include the Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), the Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (LHMU), the Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), the Services Union (ASU) and the Union of Australia (MUA). But these affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. The AWU and the NUW, for example, are bitter rivals and the NUW sometimes aligns itself with the left. Moreover, in some cases different branches may have different factional alignment. On some issues, such as opposition to the Governments industrial relations policy, all the unions are in agreement and work as a bloc within the party.Pre-selections are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with Kernot in 1998 and again with Garrett in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Pre-selections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested along factional lines. A particularly fierce pre-selection sometimes gives rise to accusations of stacking (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in pre-selection ballots), personation, multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over pre-selections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Pre-selection results are sometimes challenged, and the National Executive is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.ALP Federal Leaders:Shown by default in chronological order of leadership{| classwikitable sortable|-!

Aachen
footnotes              Aachen (, also known in English by its French name Aix-la-Chapelle) has historically been a town in Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Aachen was a favoured residence of Charlemagne, and the place of coronation of the Kings of Germany. Geographically, Aachen is the westernmost town of Germany, located along its borders with Belgium and the Netherlands,  west of Cologne.(Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia. Columbia University. p11.) Aachen University, one of Germanys Universities of Excellence, is located in the city.(RWTH is the abbreviation of Rheinisch-Westflische Technische Hochschule, which translates into Rhine-Westphalian Technical University. The institution is commonly referred to as RWTH Aachen or simply RWTH, with the abbreviation remaining untranslated in other languages to avoid the use of the Hochschule term, which is sometimes mistakenly translated as highschool. Sometimes, RWTH Aachen is also referred to as TH Aachen or Aachen University.Note: The term FH Aachen does not refer to the RWTH but to the Aachen, a university of applied sciences, which is also located in Aachen.)(2007 statistics of RWTH Aachen University(German; retrieved 2009-04-09)) Aachens predominant economic focus is on science, engineering, information technology and related sectors. For innovation, Aachen is currently ranked 8th among cities in Germany.(Innovation Cities Index 2009)HistoryA quarry on the Lousberg, which was first used in Neolithic times, attests to the long occupation of the site of Aachen.No larger settlements, however, have been found to have existed in this remote rural area, located at least 15 km from the nearest road even in Roman times, up to the early medieval period when the place is mentioned as a kings mansion for the first time, not long before Charlemagne became ruler of the Germanic Franks.Since Roman times, the hot springs at Aachen have been channeled into baths.( There are currently two places to take the waters, at the Thermen complex and the bathhouse in Burtscheid.(Spa districts in Aachen (German))There is some documentary proof that the Romans named the hot sulfur springs of Aachen Aquis-Granum, and indeed to this day the city is known in Italian as Aquisgrana, in Spanish as Aquisgrn and in Polish as Akwizgran. The name Granus has lately been identified as that of a Celtic deity.In French-speaking areas of the former Empire, the word aquis evolved into the modern Aix.The Middle AgesFile:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by Fouquet.After Roman times, Einhard mentions that in 7656 Pippin the Younger spent both Christmas and Easter at Aquis villa (),(Ppin le Bref, Annales dginhard) which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as King of Franks, 768, Charlemagne came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time. He went on to remain there in a mansion which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the Chapel in Aachen (since 1929, cathedral) and the palatial presentation halls. Charlemagne spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in Aachen, which became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never very widely acknowledged outside the bishopric of Lige where he may still be venerated by tradition.(In 936, Otto I was crowned king of the kingdom in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. Over the next 500 years, most kings of Germany destined to reign over the Roman Empire were crowned in Aachen. The last king to be crowned here was Ferdinand I in 1531.( During the Ages, Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to Flanders, achieving a modest position in the trade in woollen cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a Free Imperial City, subject to the Emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over Burtscheid, a neighbouring territory ruled by a Benedictine abbess. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the Aachener Reich. Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the duke of Jlich; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.From the early 16th century, Aachen lost power. A fire devastated the city in 1656.(Aachen. (2006). In Britannica. Retrieved 9 December 2006, from Encyclopdia Britannica Online.) Aachen became attractive as a spa by the middle of the 17th century, not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because Aachen was then  and remained well into the 19th century  a place of high-level prostitution in Europe. Traces of this hidden agenda of the citys history is found in the 18th century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas; the main indication for visiting patients, ironically, was syphilis; only by the end of the 19th century had rheuma become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid. Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the first congress of Aachen (often referred to as Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in English) in 1668, leading to the First Treaty of Aachen in the same year which ended the of Devolution. The second congress ended with the second treaty in 1748, finishing the of the Austrian Succession.( The third congress took place in 1818 to decide the fate of occupied Napoleonic France.The nineteenth centuryBy the middle of the 19th century, industrialization swept away most of the citys medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt remains of the citys medival constitution was kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his Ansichten vom Niederrhein) until 1801, when Aachen became the chef-lieu du dpartement de la Roer in Napolons French Empire. In 1815 after the Wars, the of Prussia took over and the city became one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.( Administered within the Province, by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1840, the railway from Cologne to Belgium passed through Aachen. The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions up to 1875 when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building operations and new, less miserable quarters were built in the eastern part of the city, where drainage of waste liquids was easiest. In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important for the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, pins, needles, buttons, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.The twentieth centuryAachen was heavily damaged during War II. The city and its fortified sourroundings were encircled 13 September-16 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division and 3rd Armored Division in conjunction with the US 2nd Armored Division and 30th Infantry Division during the prolonged of Aachen, later reinforced by US 28th Infantry Division elements. Direct assaults through the heavily defended city finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944.(Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946, Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 50, 51, 76, 105) Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies. The city was destroyed partially  and in some parts completely  during the fighting,( mostly by American artillery fire and demolitions carried out by the Waffen-SS defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of St. Foillan, St. Paul and St. Nicholas, and the Rathaus (city hall), although Cathedral was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, Oppenhoff, was murdered by an SS commando unit.While the emperors palace no longer exists, the church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.(Cathedral of Aachen) In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor Otto III. Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a UNESCO Heritage Site.Main sightsrathaus front.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aachen city hallFile:Aachen Cathedral North View at Evening.jpg|thumb|Cathedralborder as seen from the town areaCathedral was erected on the orders of Charlemagne in AD 786 and was on completion the largest cathedral north of the Alps. On his death Charlemagnes remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens.File:CarolusThermen01.JPG|thumb|200px|left|upright|In the Carolus Thermen named for Charlemagne.The 14th century city hall lies between two central places, the Markt (market place) and the Katschhof (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist Alfre Rethel which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagnes signature.The Grashaus, a late medieval house at the Markt, is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosts the city archive. The Grashaus was the former city hall before the present building took over this function.The Elisenbrunnen is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the citys famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in south-eastern direction lies the 19th century theatre.Also well-known and well worth seeing are the two remaining city gates, the Ponttor, one half mile northwest of the cathedral, and the Kleinmarschiertor, close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.There are many other places and objects worth seeing, for example a notable number of churches and monasteries, a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular Baroque style typical of the region, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, amongst others. The areas industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early twentieth-century manufacturing sites in the city.EconomyFord-Entwicklungszentrum.jpg|thumb|left|Ford Research Center, Aachen.Aachen has a large number of spin-offs from the universitys IT-technology department and is a major centre of IT development in Germany. Due to the low level of investment in cross-border railway projects, the city has preserved a slot within the Thalys high-speed train network which uses existing tracks on its last 70 km from Belgium to Cologne.The airport that serves Aachen, Aachen Airport, is located about 40 km away in Dutch territory, close to the town of Beek.Aachen was the administrative centre for the coal-mining industries in neighbouring places to the northeast; it never played any role in brown coal mining, however, neither in administrative or industrial terms.Products manufactured in or around Aachen include electronics, chemicals, plastics, textiles, glass, cosmetics, and needles and pins. Its most important source of revenue, the textile industries, have been dead for almost half a century now.TransportAachens railway station, the Hauptbahnhof, was constructed in 1841 at the Cologne-Aachen railway line and replaced in 1905, moving it significantly closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, Mnchengladbach and Lige as well as branch lines to Heerlen, Alsdorf, Stolberg and Eschweiler. ICE high speed trains from Brussels via Cologne to am Main and Thalys trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Hauptbahnhof. Four RE lines and one RB line connect Aachen with the Ruhrgebiet, Mnchengladbach, Lige, Dsseldorf and the Siegerland. The euregiobahn, a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.There are four smaller stations in Aachen: Aachen West, Aachen-Schanz, Aachen-Rothe Erde and Eilendorf. Only slower trains stop at these, but Aachen-West has developed enormous importance due to the expanding Aachen university.Aachen is connected to the Autobahn A4 (West-East), A44 (North-South) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the Europaplatz near the city centre). Due to the enormous amount of traffic at the Aachen road interchange, there is often serious traffic accumulation, which is why there are plans to expand the interchange in the coming years.The nearest airports are International Airport (80 km), Bonn Airport (90 km) and Aachen Airport (40 km).SportsFile:600px Alemannia Aachen.png|thumb|Aachen The annual CHIO (short for the French term Concours Hippique International Officiel) is the biggest equestrian meeting of the world and among horsemen considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of Wimbledon for tennis. Aachen hosted the FEI World Equestrian Games and CHIO Aachen.The local football team Aachen had a short run-out in Germanys first division, after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the second division.The stadium Tivoli, opened in 1928, served as the venue for the teams home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division. Today, the stadium is used by the amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club holds its games in the new stadium Neuer Tivoli  meaning New Tivoli- a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32.960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.In the South of the city you can find Aachens biggest tennis club TC Grn Weiss, which hosts the famous ATP Tournament once a year.AwardsSince 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Karlspreis (German for Charlemagne Award) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to the President of the United States, Clinton, for his special personal contribution to cooperation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and human rights in Europe, and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2003 the medal was awarded to Giscard dEstaing. In 2004, John Paul IIs efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal, which was awarded for the first time ever. Most recently in 2011, the Charlemagne Award was conferred on Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank. He was acknowledged for his critical role in the stability of the euro despite the economic crises that prevailed in many economic powers.GeographyAachen is at the western end of the line that divides High German to the south from the rest of the West Germanic speech area to the north. Aachen has the hottest springs of Europe with water temperatures of 74C(165F). The water contains a considerable percentage of common salt and other sodium salts and sulphur. As a spa city, Aachen could use the title Bad  Aachen, but as the town then would not then appear in first place on alphabetically ordered lists, it declined to do so.CultureFile:Aachen Rosenmontag 2009.jpg|thumb|Aachen is also famous for its carnival (Karneval, Fasching), in which families dress in colorful costumes.In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an Domini date on a general circulation coin, a groschen.The Scotch-Club in Aachen was the first discothque since October 19, 1959. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.The local specialty of Aachen is an originally stonehard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called Printen. Unlike gingerbread (), which is sweetened with honey, Printen are sweetened with sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.Notable residentsvan der Rohe - Wohnhaus II.JPG|thumb|House of the family of Mies van der Rohe.King Ethelwulf of Wessex, father of the Great was born in Aachen.

The university clinics attached to the RWTH, the Aachen, is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.() Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a garden (the Garten Aachen).Aachen, University of Applied Sciences (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions like Mechatronics, Construction Engineering, Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programs and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or Doppeldiplome (double degrees). Foreign students accounts for more than 21% of the student body.The Armys Technical School (Technische Schule des Heeres und Fachschule des Heeres fr Technik) is in Aachen.International relationsAachen is twinned with:*  Lige, Belgium; since 1955.*  Reims, France; since 1967.*  Halifax, England, Kingdom; since 1979.*  Toledo, Mancha, Spain; since 1985.*  Ningbo, China; since 1986.*  Naumburg, Germany; since 1988.*  Arlington County, Virginia, States; since 1993.*  Town, Africa; since 1999.(Aachen-Kapstadt.de)*  Kostroma, Russia; since 2005.*  HaAyin, Israel; since 2007.*  Baltimore, Ireland; since 2010.See also*(district)*tram*Aachener*Bachverein*of mayors of Aachen*of Aix-la-ChapelleNotesExternal links*City of Aachen (partly available in English)*Aachen-emotion.com  photos, interviews, stories, audio files and video clips featuring Aachen  presented by Aachen City Council.

Ainu_people
 related The  , also called Aynu, Aino (), and in historical texts Ezo (), are indigenous people or groups in Japan and Russia. Historically they spoke the language and related varieties and lived in Hokkaid, the Islands, and much of Sakhalin. Most of those who identify themselves as Ainu still live in this same region, though the exact number of living Ainu is unknown. This is due to confusion over mixed heritages and to issues in Japan resulting in those with Ainu backgrounds hiding their identities. In Japan, because of intermarriage over many years with Japanese, the concept of a pure Ainu ethnic group is no longer feasible.(Encyclopedia of bilingualism and bilingual education, Volume 1997 By Colin Baker, Sylvia Prys Jones) Official estimates of the population are of around 25,000, while the unofficial number is upward of 200,000 people.(HistoryAinu culture dates from around 1200 CE() and recent research suggests that it originated in a merger of the Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures.(Sato, Takehiro; et al. (2007). Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis. Journal of Human Genetics 52 (7): 618627. doi:10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z) In 1264, people reported to the Dynasty of the Empire that Ainu invaded the land of Nivkh, resulting in battles between Ainu and the Yuan Dynasty.() Active contact between the Wajin (the ethnically Japanese) and the Ainu of Ezochi (now known as Hokkaido) began in the 13th century.(Weiner, M (eds) 1997, Japans Minorities: The Illusion of Homogeneity, Routledge, London.) The Ainu were a society of hunter-gatherers, who lived mainly by hunting and fishing, and the people followed a religion based on phenomena of nature.(NOVA Online  Island of the Spirits  Origins of the Ainu. Retrieved on May 8, 2008.)During the Tokugawa period (16001868) the Ainu became increasingly involved in trade with Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island that is now called Hokkaido. The Bakufu government granted the clan exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the Northern part of the island. Later the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period Ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by Japanese, and suffered from epidemic diseases such as smallpox.(Brett L. Walker, The conquest of Ainu Lands:Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion 1590-1800-University of California Press,2001,Pages 4956,6171 and Pages 172176) Although trade contributed to better understandings between the Japanese and the Ainu sometimes it also led to conflict, some of these became violent Ainu revolts of which the most important was Revolt (16691672).The turning point for Ainu culture was the beginning of the Restoration in 1868. A variety of social, political and economic reforms were introduced by the Japanese government, in hope of modernising the country in the Western style, and included the annexation of Hokkaido.  Sjberg quotes Babas (1980) account of the Japanese governments reasoning:(  The development of Japans large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia.  Second  it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class  Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy.(Sjberg, K 1993, The Return of the Ainu, Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland.)In 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labeling the Ainu as former aborigines, with the idea they would assimilatethis resulted in the land the Ainu people lived on being taken by the Japanese government, and was from then on under Japanese control.(Loos, N & Osani, T 1993, Indigenous Minorities and Education, Sanyusha Publishing Co., Ltd., Tokyo.) Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own landover a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese.()  In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wajin who had decided to move to Hokkaido, who had been encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the islands abundance of natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of western industrial agriculture.   This development was termed Kaitakushi.(Hohmann, S 2008, The Ainus modern struggle in World Watch, Vol 21, No. 6, pp. 2024.)  As well as this, factories such as flour mills and beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904.(Sjberg, K 1993, The Return of the Ainu, Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland, p. 117.)  During this time the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.()The 1899 act mentioned above was replaced in 1997until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups.( It was not until June 6, 2008 that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see Official Recognition, below).(Ainu Dub Band at tff.Rudolstadt 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The Oki Dub Ainu Band, led by the Ainu Japanese musician Oki, in Germany in 2007Intermarriages between Japanese and Ainu were actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, Oki, born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument tonkori.() There are many small towns in the southeastern or Hidaka region where full-blooded Ainu may still be seen such as in Nibutani (Ainu: Niputay). In Sambutsu especially, on the eastern coast, many children of such marriages may be seen.Their most widely known ethnonym is derived from the word ainu, which means human (particularly as opposed to kamui, divine beings), basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race, in the Hokkaid dialects of the language; Emishi (Ebisu) and Ezo  (Yezo)  (both ) are Japanese terms, which are believed to derive from another word for human, which otherwise survived in Sakhalin Ainu as enciw or enju. Today, many Ainu dislike the term Ainu because it had once been used with derogatory nuance, and prefer to identify themselves as Utari (comrade in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.Official recognitionOn June 6, 2008, a bi-partisan, non-binding resolution was approved by the Diet calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as indigenous to Japan and urge an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognised the Ainu people as an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture and rescinds the law passed in 1899.(()Though the resolution is historically significant, Hideaki Uemura, professor at University in Tokyo and a specialist in indigenous peoples rights, commented that the motion is weak in the sense of recognizing historical facts as the Ainu were forced to become Japanese in the first place.(OriginsThe origins of the Ainu have often been considered Jmon-jin, natives to Japan from the period.() The  lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the Children of the Sun came is told in one of their Yukar Upopo (Ainu legends).()Ainu culture as it is known today dates from around the year 1200( and recent research suggests that it originated in a merger of the Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures, one of the ancient Japanese cultures.() Their economy was based on farming as well as hunting, fishing and gathering.()Full-blooded Ainu are lighter skinned than their Japanese neighbors and have more body hair.(Travis, John Jomon Genes:Using DNA, researchers probe the genetic origins of modern Japanese Science News February 15, 1997 Vol. 151 No. 7 p. 106 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n7_v151/ai_19143382/) Many early investigators proposed a Caucasian ancestry,(1911 Encyclopdia Britannica/Ainu) although recent DNA tests have not shown any genetic similarity with modern caucasian Europeans.(dreamersrise.blogspot.com/2009_05_01_archive.html) Many Ainu people have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. Ainu also have very long beards, ranging from straight to wavy.Genetic testing of the Ainu people has shown them to belong mainly to Y-haplogroup D2.() Y-DNA haplogroup D2 is found frequently throughout the Archipelago including Okinawa. The only places outside of Japan in which Y-haplogroup D is common are Tibet and the Islands in the Indian Ocean.(http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf)left|thumb|170px|1862 illustration of Ainu (left) and NivkhsIn a study by Tajima et al. (2004), two out of a sample of sixteen (or 12.5%) Ainu men have been found to belong to Haplogroup C3, which is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of the Far East and Mongolia.( Hammer et al. (2006) have tested a sample of four Ainu men and have found that one of them belongs to haplogroup C3.() Some researchers have speculated that this minority of Haplogroup C3 carriers among the Ainu may reflect a certain degree of unidirectional genetic influence from the Nivkhs, a traditionally nomadic people of northern Sakhalin Island and the adjacent mainland, with whom the Ainu have long-standing cultural interactions.(Based on analysis of one sample of 51 modern Ainus, their mtDNA lineages have been reported to consist mainly of haplogroup Y (11/51  21.6% according to Tanaka et al. 2004, or 10/51  19.6% according to Adachi et al. 2009, who have cited Tajima et al. 2004), haplogroup D (9/51  17.6%, particularly D4(xD1)), haplogroup M7a (8/51  15.7%), and haplogroup G1 (8/51  15.7%).(()(Noboru Adachi, Ken-ichi Shinoda, Kazuo Umetsu, and Hirofumi Matsumura, Mitochondrial DNA Analysis of Jomon Skeletons From the Funadomari Site, , and Its Implication for the Origins of Native American, American Journal of Physical Anthropology 138:255265 (2009))Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup Y is otherwise found mainly among Nivkhs, and with lower frequency among peoples, Koreans, Mongols (including Kalmyks and Buryats), Chinese, Japanese, Asians, South Siberian Turkic peoples (e.g. Tuvans, Todjins, Soyots), Koryaks, Alyutors, Itelmens, aborigines, Filipinos, Indonesians, and Malaysians. MtDNA Haplogroup D is found frequently throughout East Asia and Central Asia, and is also common in some populations of North Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Americas; in addition, it has been found with low frequency in some populations of Europe and Southwest Asia. Haplogroup M7a has been found elsewhere mainly among Japanese and Ryukyuans, and with lower frequency among Udegeys, Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, aborigines, Buryats, Asians, and Waars of the Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, India.((Han-Jun Jin, Ki-Cheol Kim, and Wook Kim, Genetic Diversity of Two Haploid Markers in the Udegey Population From Southeastern Siberia, American Journal of Physical Anthropology (2010))(Miroslava Derenko, Boris Malyarchuk, Tomasz Grzybowski, Galina Denisova, Irina Dambueva, Maria Perkova, Choduraa Dorzhu, Faina Luzina, Hong Kyu Lee, Tomas Vanecek, Richard Villems, and Ilia Zakharov, Phylogeographic Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA in Northern Asian Populations, American Journal of Human Genetics, 2007 November; 81(5): 10251041.)(Toomas Kivisild, Helle-Viivi Tolk, Jri Parik, Yiming Wang, Surinder S.

MtDNA Haplogroup G has been found most frequently among indigenous populations of easternmost Siberia, but it is also common among some populations of East Asia, Central Asia, the Altai-Sayan region of southern Siberia, and the sub-Himalayan region.A recent reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the Jmon.() This agrees with the reference to the Ainu culture being a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures referenced above.After a new wave of immigration, probably from the Korean Peninsula some 2,300 years ago, of the people, the Jmon were pushed into northern Japan. Genetic data suggest that modern Japanese are descended from both the Yayoi and the Jmon.GeographyThe Ainu were distributed in the northern and central islands of Japan, from Sakhalin island in the north to the Kuril islands and the island of Hokkaid and Northern Honsh, although some investigators place their former range as throughout Honsh and as far north as the southern tip of the Peninsula in what is now Lopatka. The island of Hokkaido was known to the Ainu as Ainu Moshir, and was formally annexed by the Japanese at the late date of 1868, partly as a means of preventing the intrusion of the Russians, and partly for imperialist reasons.According to the Empire Census of 1897, 1446 persons in the Russian Empire reported Ainu language as their mother tongue, 1434 of them in Sakhalin Island.(Russian Empire Census of 1897: TotalsRussian Empire Census of 1897: Sakhalin )The southern half of Sakhalin was acquired by Japan as a result of the War of 190405, but at the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviets declared war on Japan and took possession of the Kuril islands and southern Sakhalin. The Ainu population, as previously Japanese subjects, were repatriated to Japan.According to the 2002 Russian Federation census, no responders gave the ethnonym Ainu in boxes 7 or 9.2 in the K-1 form of the census,(http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls)(http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-3.xls)(http://www.perepis2002.ru/index.html?id87) though some still might exist.The only Ainu speakers remaining (besides perhaps a few partial speakers) live solely in Japan. There, they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of Hokkaid.Due to intermarriage with the Japanese and ongoing absorption into the predominant culture, there are no truly Ainu settlements existing in Japan today. The town of Nibutani (Ainu: Niputay) in Hidaka area (Hokkaido prefecture) has a number of Ainu households and a visit to some of the Ainu owned craft shops close to the Ainu museums (there are two of them in Nibutani) is an opportunity to interact with the Ainu people. Many authentic Ainu villages advertised in Hokkaido such as Akan and Shiraoi are tourist attractions and provide an opportunity to see and meet Ainu people.LanguageToday, it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remain,(Hohmann, S. 2008, The Ainus modern struggle in World Watch, Vol 21., No. 6, pp. 2024.) while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers  the language has been regarded as endangered.(Vovin, A. 1993, A Reconstruction of Proto-Ainu, Brill, p. 3)  As a result of this the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.The Ainu language is significantly different from the Japanese language in its syntax, phonology, morphology, and vocabulary. Although there have been attempts to show that they are related, modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact, such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu.(Shibatani, M. 1990, The Languages of Japan, Cambridge University Press, London, p. 3)  In fact, no attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a isolate.(Shibatani, M. 1990, The Languages of Japan, Cambridge university Press, London, p. 5)Words used as prepositions in English (such as to, from, by, in, and at) are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or agglutinated sounds or morphemes that represent nouns or ideas.The Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese kana or the Russian Cyrillic.  Today, it is typically written in either katakana or Latin alphabet. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu.  For example, some words, such as Kor (meaning to hold), are now pronounced with a terminal vowel sound, as in Koro.Many of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the Yukar, or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.(Omniglot, 2009, Ainu, retrieved August 2, 2009, http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ainu.htm)CultureFile:Ainu ceremonial dress.jpg|thumb|Ainu ceremonial dress. Museum.Traditional Ainu culture was quite different from Japanese culture. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full beards and moustaches. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women tattooed their mouths, and sometimes the forearms. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for color. Their traditional dress was a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree, called attusi or attush. Various styles of clothing were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.Modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or salmon. Both sexes are fond of earrings, which are said to have been made of grapevine in former times, as also are bead necklaces called tamasay, which the women prized highly.Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of bear, fox, wolf, badger, ox or horse, as well as fish, fowl, millet, vegetables, herbs, and roots. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest  square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center. There was no chimney, only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed.Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (iris pseudacorus, whose English names include water-flag); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaid, serving primarily Japanese fare.The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a communitys members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. Beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed.HuntingThe Ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer. The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn, gathering, salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered. A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor) . Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory. The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of deer), rabbit, fox, dog and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu as were salmon. They also hunted eagles such as sea eagles, raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese. The Ainu hunted with arrows and spears with poison-coated points. They obtained the poison, called surku, from the roots and stalks of aconites. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dogs bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, tobacco, and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers. They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the god of fire and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.The Ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw. At that time bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an amappo.The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also they often used traps, including spring traps loaded with arrows. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.ReligionThe Ainu are traditionally animists, believing that everything in nature has a kamuy (spirit or god) on the inside. There is a hierarchy of the kamui.The most important is grandmother earth (fire), then kamui of the mountain (animals), then kamui of the sea (sea animals), lastly everything else. They have no priests by profession.The village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary; ceremonies are confined to making libations of rice beer, uttering prayers, and offering willow sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called inaw (singular) and nusa (plural).They are placed on an altar used to send back the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called Iomante. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of sickness. They believe their spirits are immortal, and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to kamui mosir (Land of the Gods).The Ainu believe the bear is very special because they think the bear is the mountain kamuys way of delivering the gift of bear hide and meat to the humans.Some Ainu in the north are members of the Orthodox Church.OrnamentsMen wore a crown called sapanpe for important ceremonies. Sapanpe was made from wood fiber with bundles of partially-shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its center. Men carried an emush (sword) secured by an emush at strap to their shoulders.Women wore a matanpushi (embroidered headband) and ninkari (earrings).Ninkari was a metal ring with a ball. Women wore it through a hole in the ear. Matanpushi and ninkari were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called maidari now are a part of womens formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called tekunkani.Women wore a necklace called rekutunpe, a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques. They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a tamasay or shitoki, usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent. The Ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the Matsumae Clan.HousingA village is called a kotan in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal clan. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.Kotan houses were made of grasses, grass, barks, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the rorun-puyar, a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplaces left side (called shiso) . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplaces right side (called harkiso). The house had a platform for valuables called iyoykir behind the shiso. The Ainu placed shintoko(hokai) and ikayop (quivers) there.Outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ashinru and for women called menokoru, a pu (storehouse) for food, a heper set (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar nusasan faced the east side of the house (rorunpuyar). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as lyomante, a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.Life of AinuThe Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called tunpu annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.The age of marriage was 1718 years old for men and 1516 years for women, who were tattooed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts with each other. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, Ieggings, and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many yomeiri marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.For a yomeiri marriage, a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, including a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket (hokai). If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house. At the wedding ceremony, participants prayed to the god of fire. Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl, and other participants were entertained.The worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as attush, until coming of age.Newborn babies were named ayay (a babys crying), shipo, poyshi (small excrement), shion (old excrement), etc. Children were called by these temporary names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born. Their tentative names had a portion meaning excrement or old things to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behavior or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.Men wore loincloths and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 1516. Women were also considered adults at the age of 1516. They wore underclothes called mour and had their hair dressed properly and wound waistcloths called raunkut, ponkut, etc. around their bodies. When women reached age 1213, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed. When they reached age 1516, their tattoos were completed. Thus were they qualified for marriage.American continent connection theoryIn the late 20th century, speculation arose that people of the group related to the Jmon may have been one of the first to settle America. This theory is based largely on skeletal and cultural evidence among tribes living in the western part of North America and certain parts  of America.It is possible that North America had several peoples among its early settlersthese relatives of the Jmon being one of them. The best known evidence that may support this theory is probably Man.(Kennewick Man Skeletal Find May Revolutionalize Continents History, Science Daily, April 2006.)(ANTHROPOLOGY: Kennewick Mans Contemporaries, Science.)Genetic mapping studies by Cavalli-Sforza have shown a sharp gradient in gene frequencies centered in the area around the of Japan, and particularly in the Archipelago, that distinguishes these populations from others in the rest of eastern Asia and most of the American continent. This gradient appears as the third most important genetic movement (in other words, the third principal component of genetic variation) in Eurasia (after the Great expansion from Africa, which has a cline centered in Arabia and adjacent parts of the East, and a second cline that distinguishes the northern regions of Eurasia and particularly Siberia from regions to the south), which would make it consistent with the early Jmon period, or possibly even the pre-Jmon period.(Cavalli-Sforza. The History and Geography of Human Genes p.253, ISBN 0-691-08750-4: The synthetic maps suggest a previously unsuspected center of expansion from the Sea of Japan but cannot indicate dates. This development could be tied to the Jmon period, but one cannot entirely exclude the pre-Jmon period and that it might be responsible for a migration to the Americas. A major source of food in those pre-agricultural times came from fishing, then as now, and this would have limited for ecological reasons the area of expansion to the coastline, perhaps that of the Sea of Japan, but also father along the Pacific Coast.)InstitutionsFile:Ainu promotion center, Sapporo.JPG|thumb|Ainu cultural promotion center and museum, in Sapporo  (Sapporo Pirka Kotan)Most Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the Utari Association. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese nation-state. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.Other key institutions include The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC), set up by the Japanese Government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaido University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers.  Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.(Links to these organizations needed, also Tokyo Ainu documentary, http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/top.htm, and http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/groups.htm has links to Tokyo area Ainu groups.)Current affairsLitigationOn March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the River watershed in southern Hokkaido. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan.(Mark A. Levin, Essential Commodities and Racial Justice: Using Constitutional Protection of Japans Indigenous Ainu People to Inform Understandings of the United States and Japan, New York University Journal of International Law and Politics, Vol. 33, pp. 445-46, 2001)  The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to Nibutani village,(Levin, Mark (trans.), Kayano et al. v. Hokkaido Expropriation Committee: The Nibutani Dam Decision (1999). International Legal Materials, Vol. 38, p. 394, 1999. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract1635447 p. 11) the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history.(Mark A. Levin, Essential Commodities p. 447)  In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and Kayano Shigeruwell-known and important leaders in the Ainu community.(Idem., p. 443)  After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaido Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawas son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaido Development Bureau.The final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasonsthe dam was already standingbut the decision was nonetheless heralded as a giant victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders.(Nibutani Dam Decision (Levin trans.); see also Idem., p. 442)  The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japans majority, referred to as Wajin in the case and discussions about the case.(Nibutani Dam Decision (Levin trans.); see also Mark A. Levin, The Wajins Whiteness: Law and Race Privilege in Japan, Horitsu Jiho, Vol. 80, No. 2, 2008)  The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japans Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.(postscript )(postscript )  The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two week later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Actthe 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years.(Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture & Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions (Hitchingham trans.); see also, Mark A. Levin, Essential Commodities p. 467)  While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japans view of the Ainu people is a testament to the importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the Cultural Landscape along the Sarugawa River resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement was designated an Important Cultural Landscape.() A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.(Citation to Levin and Tsunemoto in Oklahoma Law Review)Governmental advisory boardsMuch national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as shingikai/ in Japanese.  One such committee operated in the late 1990s,(Citation to Siddles book) and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law.(Act for the Promotion of Ainu Culture & Dissemination of Knowledge Regarding Ainu Traditions (Hitchingham trans.))  This panels circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.(More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included.  It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.SubgroupsFile:Sakhalin ainu men II.jpg|thumb|Sakhalin Ainu men, photographed by Pisudski.Ainu dwelling.jpg|thumb|Kuril Ainu people in front of the traditional dwelling.*Hokkaido Ainu (the predominant community of Ainu in the world today)  A Japanese census in 1916 returned 13,557 pure blooded Ainu in addition to 4,550 multiracial individuals.()*Tokyo Ainu (a modern age migration of Hokkaido Ainu highlighted in a documentary film released in 2010, http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/top.htm)*Tohoku Ainu (from Honsh, no officially-acknowledged population exists)  43 Ainu households scattered throughout the Tohoku region were reported during the 17th century.(Honda, Katsuichi (2000). Harukor: an Ainu womans tale. of California Press via Books. p. 7.) There are people who consider themselves descendants of Shimokita Ainu on the Peninsula, while the people on the Peninsula are generally considered as Yamato people but may be descendants of Tsugaru Ainu after cultural assimilation.()*Sakhalin Ainu  Pure blooded individuals may be surviving in Hokkaido. From both Northern and Southern Sakhalin, a total of 841 Ainu were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. Only a few in remote interior areas remained, as the island was turned over to Russia. Even when Japan was granted Southern Sakhalin in 1905, only a handful returned. Japanese census of 1905 counted only 120 Sakhalin Ainu (down from 841 in 1875, 93 in Karafuto and 27 in Hokkaido). Russian census of 1926 counted 5 Ainu, while several of their multiracial children were recorded as ethnic Nivkh, Slav or Uilta.** North Sakhalin  Only 5 pure blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Russian Census in Northern Sakhalin. Most of the Sakhalin Ainu (mainly from coastal areas) were relocated to Hokkaido in 1875 by Japan. The few remained (mainly from remote interior) were mostly married to Russians as can be seen from the works of Pisudski.(Howell, David L. (2005). Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan. of California Press via Books. p. 187.)** Southern Sakhalin (Karafuto)  Japanese rule until 1945. Japan evacuated almost all the Ainus to Hokkaido after the WW2. Isolated individuals might have remained in Sakhalin.(http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_26.php?reg1420) In 1949, there were about 100 Ainu living in Russian Sakhalin.(Wurm, Stephen Adolphe; Mhlhusler, Peter; Tryon, Darrell T. (1996). Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia and the Americas. de Gruyter via Books. p. 1010.)*Northern Kuril Ainu (no known living population)  Also known as Kurile in Russian records. Were under Russian rule till 1875. First came under Japanese rule after the of Saint Petersburg (1875). Major population was on the island of Shumshu, with a few others in islands like Paramushir. Altogether they numbered 221 in 1860. They had Russian names, spoke Russian fluently and were Orthodox in religion. As the islands were gifted to the Japanese, more than a hundred Ainu fled to Kamchatka along with their Russian employers (where they were assimilated in to the Kamchadal population).((Minichiello, Sharon (1998). Japans competing modernities: issues in culture and democracy, 1900-1930. of Hawaii Press via Books. p. 163.) Only about half remained under Japanese rule. In order to derussify the Kurile, the entire population of 97 individuals were relocated to Shikotan in 1884, given Japanese names and children were enrolled in to Japanese schools. Unlike the other Ainu groups, the Kurile failed to adjust to their new surroundings and by 1933 only 10 individuals were alive (plus another 34 multiracial individuals). The last group of 20 individuals (including a few pure bloods) were evacuated to Hokkaido in 1941, where they vanished as a separate ethnic group soon after.(*Southern Kuril Ainu (no known living population)  Numbered almost 2,000 people (mainly in Kunashir, Iturup and Urup) during the 18th century. In 1884, their population had decreased to 500. Around 50 individuals (mostly multiracial) who remained in 1941 were evacuated to Hokkaido by the Japanese soon after WW2.( The last of the tribe, Tanaka Kinu died in Hokkaido in 1973.(http://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/10012/2765/1/Scott%20Harrison_GSO_Thesis.pdf)*Kamchatka Ainu (no known living population)  Known as Kamchatka Kurile in Russian records. Ceased to exist as a separate ethnic group after their defeat in 1706 by the Russians. Individuals were assimilated in to the Kurile and Kamchadal ethnic groups. Last recorded in 18th century by Russian explorers.(Shibatani, Masayoshi (1990). The languages of Japan. University Press via Books. p. 3.)*Amur Valley Ainu (probably none remain)  a few individuals married to ethnic Russians and ethnic Ulchi reported by Bronisaw Pisudski in early 20th century.(Pisudski, Bronisaw; Majewicz, Alfred F. (2004). The collected works of Bronisaw Pisudski Volume 3. de Gruyter via Books. p. 816.) Only 26 pure blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Russian Census in Nikolaevski Okrug (present day   Nikolaevskij Region/District).(http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_26.php?reg1410) Probably assimilated in to the Slavic rural population. Although no one identifies as Ainu nowadays in Krai, there are a large number of ethnic Ulch with partial Ainu ancestry.(Shaman: an international journal for Shamanistic research, Volumes 4-5 p.155)(Pisudski, Bronisaw; Majewicz, Alfred F.
