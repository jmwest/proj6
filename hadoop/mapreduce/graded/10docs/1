American_National_Standards_Institute
remarks             The American National Standards Institute (ANSI,  ) is a private organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.  For example, standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe. ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of standards developing organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.(ANSI 2009 Annual Report)The organizations headquarters are in DC. ANSIs operations office is located in York City. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs. History ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). In 1928, the AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). The present name was adopted in 1969.Prior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies:*Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, now IEEE)*Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)*Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)*American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers)*American Society for Testing and Materials (now International)had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES).At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the of Defense or DOD) and Commerce(ANSI history- Retrieved 2011-09-27) to join in founding a national standards organization.According to Paul G. Agnew, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else.  Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME.  An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.(http://www.iec.ch/)MembersANSIs membership comprises government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.(ANSI membership page, www.ansi.org/membership)ProcessThough ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institutes requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.( Value of the ANS Designation brochure)Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.The American National Standards process involves:*consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties*broad-based public review and comment on draft standards*consideration of and response to comments*incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard*availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.International activitiesIn addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the U.S., ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.The Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the Organization for Standardization (ISO), as a founding member(ISO founding member- Retrieved 2011-09-27), and the Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.Standards panelsThe Institute administers five standards panels:*The ANSI Biofuels Standards Panel (ANSI-BSP)*The Information Technology Standards Panel*The ANSI Homeland Security Standards Panel*The ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel*The Identity Theft Prevention and Identity Management Standards PanelEach of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas. In 2009, ANSI and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry. American national standards*The ASA (as for American Standards Association) photographic exposure system, originally defined in ASA Z38.2.1 (since 1943) and ASA PH2.5 (since 1954), together with the DIN system (DIN 4512 since 1934), became the basis for the ISO system (since 1974), currently used worldwide (6, 2240, 5800, 12232).*A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers.  The ANSI code standard extended the previously created ASCII seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code or EBCDIC).  In Windows, the phrase ANSI refers to the Windows ANSI code pages (even though they are not ANSI standards).(Microsoft Glossary) Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for languages are variable width. Since these characters are based on a draft of the ISO-8859 series, some of Microsofts symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.*The first computer language standard was American Standard Fortran (informally known as FORTRAN 66), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.*The original standard implementation of the programming language C was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known C.*The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.*The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool & Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.*The ANSI/HI (Institute) standards used for pumps.*The ANSI for protection is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear.

Alkali_metal
The alkali metals are a series of elements in the table. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals are called the Group 1 elements. Previously, they were called the Group IA elements, with A representing the group elements and numeral I representing the first group within the main-group series. The alkali metals include lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs)groupnote and francium (Fr).(.) Hydrogen (H), although nominally also a member of Group 1,( very rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to the alkali metals. This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table, which means that all its elements have their outermost electron in an s-orbital. The s-block also includes earth metals, plus hydrogen and helium. The alkali metals provide one of the best examples of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with well characterized homologous behaviour down the group.All of the alkali metals discovered, are naturally occurring, although francium is the second-rarest naturally occurring element. These metals possess similar chemical properties: They are all highly reactive metals under standard conditions. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of the next member of the group, which is probably ununennium (Uue), but these have all met with failure, but, since ununennium is the first 8 element and only the first element on the periodic table that has not been discovered, it is likely to be found in the near future. Note that ununennium may not be the next alkali metal due to effects.CharacteristicsChemistryLike other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its configuration, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behaviour:The alkali metals are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They also tarnish easily and have low melting points and densities.()The alkali metals are mostly silver-colored, except for metallic caesium, which can have a golden tint. These elements are all soft metals of low density. In chemical terms, all of the alkali metals react aggressively with the halogens to form salts. They all react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides. The vigor of reaction increases down the group. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionization energies in their periods of the table because of their low nuclear charge and high electropositivity. The second energy of all of the alkali metals is very high, thus they always form M+ cations. thumb|Series of alkali metals, stored in mineral oil (Natrium is sodium.)All of the alkali metals are notable for their vigorous reactions with water, and these reactions become increasingly vigorous when going down their column in the periodic table towards the heaviest alkali metals, such as caesium. Their chemical reactions with water are as follows:Alkali metal + water  Alkali metal hydroxide + hydrogen gasFor a typical example (M represents an alkali metal)::2 M (s) + 2 H2O (l)  2 MOH (aq) + H2 (g)Alkali metals form a very wide range of amalgams.()They tend to form ionically bonded salts with most electronegative elements on the periodic table, like fluoride and chloride.PhysicsPotassium and rubidium are naturally weakly radioactive as they have naturally occurring radioisotopes ( and ) and franciums only naturally occurring isotope () is also radioactive with a half-life of only 22.0 minutes. Caesium was also thought to have natural radioisotopes before the discovery of francium, which made the group strange compared to the others.The alkali metals show a number of trends when moving down the group  for instance: decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling point. In general, their densities increase, with the notable exception that potassium is less dense than sodium, and the possible exception of francium, whose physical properties have not been measured because it exists only in small quantities due to its high radioactivity.Below, hydrogen is included for comparison.()HydrogenThe element hydrogen, with its solitary one electron per atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not counted as an alkali metal. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule.The removal of the single electron of hydrogen requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron from the atoms of the alkali metals. As in the halogens, only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion. compounds of hydrogen with the alkali metals and some metals have been produced in the laboratory, but these are only laboratory curiosities without much practical use. Under extremely high pressures and low temperatures, such as those found at the cores of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic, and it behaves like an alkali metal. This type of hydrogen is known as hydrogen.Hydrogen is sometimes considered to be an alkali metal, as it, like the other alkali metals, has one valence electron; however, hydrogen rarely acts like an alkali metal, as can be seen from the data above. In fact, it is sometimes placed over lithium (due to its configuration),() sometimes carbon (due to its electronegativity)( and sometimes fluorine (due to its chemical properties).()Ammonium ionThe ammonium ion resembles the heavier alkali metals and is considered a close relative of the alkali metals.()HistoryLithiumPetalite (LiAlSi4O10) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist Bonifcio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Sweden.()()() However, it was not until 1817 that August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jakob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.()()() This element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline.() Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name lithion/lithina, from the Greek word o (transliterated as lithos, meaning stone), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material as lithium.((()SodiumAlthough sodium (sometimes called soda in English) has long been recognized in compounds, it was not isolated until 1807 by Davy through the electrolysis of soda.()PotassiumPotassium metal was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH), by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly discovered pile. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.() Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (soda, NaOH, or lye), not a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different.()()()()RubidiumBunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by analysis. Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Bunsen and Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope. Because of the bright red lines in its spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, dark red.()()CaesiumIn 1860, Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the water from Drkheim, Germany. Due to the bright-blue lines in its spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue.()((Bunsen quotes Gellius Noctes Atticae II, 26 by Figulus: Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.)(English Dictionary, 2nd Edition) Caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically, only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.()FranciumFrancium (then known as eka-caesium, because it is below caesium in the table) was discovered in 1939 by Perey of the Curie Institute in France when she purified a sample of actinium-227, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the decay of actinium-227.(Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B. (2005-09-25). Francium (Atomic Number 87), the Last Discovered Natural Element. The Chemical Educator 10 (5). Retrieved on 2007-03-26.) Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.()Before Pereys discovery of francium, there were at least three erroneous and incomplete discoveries.()()()()Eka-franciumThe next element below francium is expected to be ununennium (Uue), element 119, although this is not certain. The synthesis of ununennium was attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb.()()\,^{254}_{99}\mathrm{Es} + \,^{48}_{20}\mathrm{Ca} \to \,^{302}_{119}\mathrm{Uue} ^{*} \to \  \ no\ atomsIt is highly unlikely that this reaction will be useful, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of 254Es to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level, due to the rarity of the element, and extreme rarity of the isotope. However, given that ununennium is only the first 8 element on the periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet. It is also possible that, due to drip instabilities, only the lower period 8 elements are physically possible.Regardless of what the next element below francium actually is, it will still be known as eka-francium, as it is below francium in the table.ProductionLithiumSince the end of War II, lithium production has greatly increased. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals such as those above. Lithium salts are extracted from the water of springs, brine pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused chloride and chloride.()SodiumSodium was first produced commercially in 1855 by thermal reduction of carbonate with carbon at 1100 C, in what is known as the process.(Eggeman, Tim. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published online 2007. ): Na2CO3 (l) + 2 C (s)  2 Na (g) + 3 CO (g)A process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.( Sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of liquid chloride, based on a process patented in 1924.(Pauling, Linus, General Chemistry, 1970 ed., Dover Publications)() This is done in a Cell in which the NaCl is mixed with chloride to lower the point below 700 C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be formed at the anode. This method is less expensive than the previous process of electrolyzing hydroxide. Very pure sodium can be isolated by the thermal decomposition of azide.(Merck Index, 9th ed., monograph 8325)PotassiumPure potassium metal may be isolated by electrolysis of its hydroxide in a process that has changed little since Davy.() Thermal methods also are employed in potassium production, using chloride.Potassium salts such as carnallite, langbeinite, polyhalite, and sylvite form extensive deposits in ancient lake and seabeds,() making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable. The principal source of potassium  potash  is mined in Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, States, Jordan, and other places around the world.()()()RubidiumAlthough rubidium is more abundant in Earths crust than caesium the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year.() There are several methods to separate potassium, rubidium and caesium. The crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)212H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Reports of two other methods are given in the literature the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.(()For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium.() Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the  Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite.(CaesiumThe mining of pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.(()FranciumFile:Pichblende.jpg|thumb|This sample of uraninite contains about 100,000 atoms (3.3 g) of francium-223 at any given time.(|altA shiny gray 5-centimeter piece of matter with a rough surface.Francium-223 is the result of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals.( In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 11018 uranium atoms.( It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earths crust at any time.() This makes it the second rarest element in the crust after astatine.((Francium can also be synthesized in the nuclear reaction::197Au + 18O  210Fr + 5 nThis process, developed by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211,() which are then isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT).()Eka-franciumUnunennium has not been produced yet as of .((OccurrenceLithiumAlthough lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity.( The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm),()() or 25 micromolar;()higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near vents.(SodiumOwing to its high reactivity, sodium is found in nature only as a compound and never as the free element. Sodium makes up about 2.6% by weight of the Earths crust, making it the sixth most abundant element overall() and the most abundant alkali metal. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater, as well as in solid deposits (halite). Others include amphibole, cryolite, niter, and zeolite.PotassiumPotassium does not occur as the free element in nature due to its reactivity but, in compounds, makes up 1.5% of the weight of crust and is the seventh-most-abundant chemical element.RubidiumRubidium is roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite.CaesiumCaesium is more abundant than antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, and much more abundant than mercury or silver, but 30 times less abundant than rubidium  with which it is so closely chemically associated.()FranciumFrancium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium,() is the result of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals() In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 11018 uranium atoms.()() It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earths crust at any time.( This makes it the second-rarest element in the crust after astatine.(()Eka-franciumUnunennium has not been discovered as of .((ApplicationsAll of the alkali metals have very many applications, some of which are mentioned in the links below:*Lithium applications*Sodium applications*Potassium applications*Rubidium uses and applications*Caesium applications*Francium applicationsBiological occurrences*Lithium has several biological effects. carbonate is used to treat disorder (manic-depression) disorders as it works as a mood stabiliser, although there are side-effects, e.g. excessive ingestion of lithium poisons the nervous system, which is even more dangerous, as the lethal dose is only just above the therapeutic dose. Lithium is present in the human body at about 30 ppb.(accessdate15 February 2011)*Sodium is an essential element for survival as its cation, Na+, is important for nerve function.

Rubidium is present in the body at about 4.6 ppm.(accessdate15 February 2011)*Caesium has no biological role, but can replace potassium to some extent in the body due to having similar chemical properties. Thus, caesium compounds should be avoided when possible, especially those containing radioisotopes of caesium, such as 134Cs and 137Cs. Rats fed caesium instead of potassium die. Caesium chloride (non-radioactive) has also promoted as an alternative cancer therapy,() but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, when it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.(Wood, Leonie. ) Caesium is present in the body at about 20 ppb.(accessdate15 February 2011)*Francium has no biological role(accessdate15 February 2011) and would most likely be extremely toxic due to its extreme radioactivity. If francium was not radioactive, based on trends it would most likely behave like caesium and would, it is presumed, be similarly toxic.PrecautionsThe alkali metals all react with water ever more violently and thus should all be handled with great care. Of note is the toxicity of caesium because it replaces potassium. Also, franciums extreme radioactivity is a great hazard, although the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is a sphere of radius 1 mm (over 300,000 neutral atoms).()See also*Hydrogen (not an alkali metal)*Lithium*Potassium*Rubidium*Caesium*Francium*Ununennium (possibly an alkali metal)*periodic table (discusses what may happen to periodic table groups at high number)*(periodic table)NotesReferencesBibliography#######External links##Science aid: Alkali metals A simple look at alkali metals#Atomic and Physical Properties of the Group 1 Elements An in-depth look at alkali metalsExplanation of above periodic table sliceLinks to related articlesalcalnast:Alcalnmetali1   alcalkovyalcalaiddda:Alkalimetalde:Alkalimetalleet:Leelismetallidel:es:Alcalinometaloalkalinodhaatualcalingl:Alcalinometalialkaliis:Alkalmlmuralcalinialkalialikalialkalenalcalicametlilb:Alkalimetallmetalaialcalitthu:Alklifmekml:alkalinl:Alkalimetaalja:1no:Alkalimetallnn:Alkalimetallnds:Alkalimetallpl:Litowcealcalinoksh:Alkalimetallalcalinqillayalkalinemetalkovkovinametalialkalifi:Alkalimetallisv:Alkalimetallth:metalloi kimzh-yue:zh:

Aruba
calling_code        297Aruba ( , ) is a 33 km-long island of the Antilles in the southern Sea, located 27 km north of the coast of Venezuela and 130 km (aprox.) east of Peninsula (Colombia). Together with Bonaire and Curaao, it forms a group referred to as the ABC islands of the Antilles, the southern island chain of the Antilles.Aruba, which has no administrative subdivisions, is one of the four constituent countries that form the of the Netherlands, together with the Netherlands, Curaao, and Maarten whose citizens share a single nationality: Dutch citizen. Its capital is Oranjestad. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of  and is densely populated with its estimated 103,000 people. It lies outside the belt.HistoryArubas first inhabitants are thought to have been Caquetos Amerinds from the Arawak tribe, who migrated there from Venezuela to escape attacks by the Caribs. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. Sea currents made canoe travel to other islands difficult, thus Caquetio culture remained closer to that of mainland America.capital OranjestadEuropeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations of Vespucci and de Ojeda in the summer of 1499. Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, he and Ojeda were likely guided there by natives of nearby islands. Both described Aruba as an island of giants, remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetos compared to Europeans. Ojeda also referred to the island as Oro Hubo, Spanish for It Had Gold. Gold was not discovered on Aruba, however, for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and brazilwood from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojedas tales spurred interest in Aruba and Spaniards soon colonized the island.()()Aruba was colonized by Spain for over a century. The Cacique or Indian Chief in Aruba, Simas, welcomed the first priests in Aruba and received from them a wooden cross as a gift.  In 1508, Alonso de Ojeda was appointed as Spains first Governor of Aruba, as part of Nueva Andaluca.Another governor appointed by Spain was Juan Martinez de Ampes. A cdula real decreed in November 1525 gave Ampes, factor of Espaola, the right to repopulate the depopulated islands of Aruba, Curaao and Bonaire.In 1528, Ampes was replaced by a representative of the House of Welser.  Aruba has been under Dutch administration since 1636, initially under Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. Under the Dutch W.I.C. administration, as New Netherland and Curaao from 1648 to 1664 and the Dutch government regulations of 1629, also applied in Aruba. The Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as Commandeur in Aruba in 1667.In August 1806, General de Miranda and a group of 200 freedom fighters on their voyage to liberate Venezuela from Spain stayed in Aruba for several weeks.In 1933 Aruba sent its first petition for Arubas separate status and autonomy to the Queen.During War II, together with Curaao, the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.  On February 16, 1942, its oil processing refinery was attacked by a German submarine (U-156) under the command of Werner Hartenstein, but the mission failed. U-156 was later (8 March 1943) destroyed by a US plane as the crew was sunbathing.(http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm) In March 1944, Roosevelt briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba. In attendance were: His Excellency, Dr. P. Kasteel, the Governor of Curaao, and his aide, Lieutenant Ivan Lansberg; Rear Admiral T. E. Chandler and his Aide, Lieutenant W. L. Edgington; Captain Jhr. W. Boreel and his aide, Lieutenant E. O. Holmberg; and the Netherlands aide to Mrs. Roosevelt, Lieutenant Commander v.d. Schatte Olivier.The islands economy has been dominated by five main industries: mining, phosphate mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), aloe export, petroleum refineries (The Lago Oil & Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.), and tourism.PoliticsFile:Koningin Beatrix in Vries.jpg|thumb|Queen Beatrix is the of state of Arubadi Aruba (front).jpg|thumb|Parliament of Aruba in Oranjestad.As a country of the of the Netherlands, Arubas politics take place within a framework of a 21-member Parliament and an eight-member Cabinet. The of Aruba is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or Parlamento) for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.()Together with the Netherlands, the countries of Aruba, Curaao and Maarten form the of the Netherlands. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission of people from the Netherlands. There is the supervision of the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands and the setting of general conditions for the admission and expulsion of aliens.Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the Union, though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.()()Moves towards independenceIn August 1947, Aruba presented its first Staatsreglement (constitution), for Arubas status aparte as the status of an autonomous state within the of the Netherlands. By 1954, the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.()In 1972, at a conference in Suriname, Croes (MEP) proposed a sui-generis Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the Antilles, each with its own nationality. Mr. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a referendum for the people of Aruba to determine Arubas separate status or Status Aparte as a full autonomous state under the crown. He proclaimed: Aruba shall never accept a federation and a second class nationality.Betico Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, a committee appointed by Croes introduced the national flag and anthem as the symbols of Arubas sovereignty and independence, and he also set 1981 as a target for Arubas independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the Nations and 82% of the participants voted for independence.The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague to prepare a study of Arubas independence, which was published in 1978, titled Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg. At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Arubas independence was set for the year 1991.In March 1983 Aruba finally reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for Arubas Independence, which would occur in a series of steps granting increasing autonomy. in August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for Arubas first parliament,  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was set for 1996.This achievement is largely due to Betico Croes and the political support of other nations like the USA, Panama, Venezuela and various European countries. Croes was later proclaimed Libertador di Aruba after his death in 1986. In 1990, movement toward independence was postponed upon the request of Arubas Prime Minister, Nelson O. Oduber. The article scheduling Arubas complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process can begin again after a referendum.LawThe Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model.  Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with a Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg (of First Instance) on Aruba, a Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie voor de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba (Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba) and the Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).(Aruba.com) The Korps Politie Aruba (Police Force) is the islands law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.()EducationArubas educational system is patterned after the Dutch system of education. There are 68 schools for primary education, 12 schools for secondary education, and 5 universities in Aruba. In 2007, there were 22,930 registered full-time students.The Government of Aruba finances the national education system, except for private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), which finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.Arubans benefit from a strong primary school education. A segmented secondary school program includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.Higher education goals can be pursued through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.Aruba is also home to two schools: University School of Medicine and University School of Medicine.GeographyAruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the Antilles island arc of the Antilles. Aruba is widely known for its white, sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents, and this is where most tourist development has taken place. The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans. The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called Hooiberg at  and Jamanota, the highest on the island at  above level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at .To the east of Aruba are Bonaire and Curaao, two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the Antilles; this group of islands is sometimes called the ABC islands. Climate The isothermal temperature of Arubas marine climate attracts tourists to the island all year round. Under Koppens climate classification, Aruba features a climate (BSh). However Aruba does not get quite as hot as other locations with a BSh climate. Temperature varies little from , moderated by constant winds from the Ocean. Yearly precipitation barely exceeds .dateFebruary 2011EconomyFile:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|200px|thumb|Iguanas on a rooftop in Aruba.Aruba enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region including a low unemployment rate. About three quarters of the Aruban national product is earned through tourism or related activities. Most tourists are from Venezuela and the States (predominantly from eastern and southern states). Before the Status Aparte (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $21,800 in 2004; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.() Its main trading partners are Venezuela, the States and the Netherlands.spending has been a staple in Arubas history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. As of 2006, the governments debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.() Aruba received some aid from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as Arubas Financial Independence) in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year. The exchange rate of the Aruban florin has remained steady in recent years at 1.79 florins to 1 dollar.(In 2006 the Aruban government has also changed several tax laws to further reduce the deficit. taxes have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the IMF. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007. The inflation on Aruba in 2007 was 8.7%.Demographicsof Aruba according to the FAO in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.Aruba is situated in the deep southern part of the Caribbean.  Because it has almost no rainfall, Aruba was saved from the plantation system and the economics of the trade.Arubas population is estimated to be 80% mestizo and 20% other ethnicities. Arawaks spoke the broken Spanish which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.  The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, left the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean, leading to a depletion of the Arawak population. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded Aboriginals remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic Arawak heritage. Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting workers to a maximum of 3 years residency on the island.Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela, far more so than neighboring Curaao and Bonaire. Much of Arubas families are present by way of Venezuela and there is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.Jewish communityToday, approximately 85 Jewish people live in Aruba.(JewishVirtualLibrary.org The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Aruba) The community officially dates back to 1754, when Moses Solomon Halevi Maduro, his wife and six children received special permission to reside on the island by the Dutch royalty. Maduro founded the main shipping company, Maduro & Sons. The Jewish cemetery, which began to be used for burials by the Jewish community beginning in 1837, contains eight tombstones dating back to 1563, the only indication of a Jewish presence on the island before the 18th century.(Marks, Yehudah. Jewish Prime Minister of Aruba Orders Pair of Tefillin. Hamodia, World News, 2 September 2010, p. B42.)The current prime minister of the island nation, Eman, is of Jewish descent.(Cities and townsThe island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities.* Oranjestad (33,000 in 2006)* Paradera* San Nicolas* Noord* Santa Cruz* SavanetaCultureOranjestad.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ornate buildings in Oranjestad, Aruba.On March 18 Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture. According to the Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of Sinterklaas on December 5 and 6 and other national holidays like April 30, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queens birthday or Dia di La Reina (Koninginnedag) is celebrated. Christmas and New Year are celebrated with the typical music and songs of gaitas for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and the ayaca, the ponche crema and ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of dollars worth of fireworks are burnt at midnight on New Years. On January 25, Croes birthday is celebrated. In June there is the celebration of the Dia di San Juan, with the song of Dera Gai. Religion also has its influences; the days of Ascension and Good Friday are also two holidays on the island.The holiday of Carnival is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like Gras, that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as Halloween and Thanksgiving Day in November.LanguageLanguage can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The official languages are Dutch and  since 2003  Papiamento. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A language spoken on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaao, it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. Like many islands in the region, Spanish is also often spoken. English has historical connections (with the Empire) and is known by many; English usage has also grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German and French. The latter is offered in high school and college, since a high percentage of Aruban students continue their studies in Europe.In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards the Portuguese roots and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. y instead of j), where others are more oriented towards the Dutch roots.In a book The Buccaneers of America, first published in 1678, it is stated by eyewitness account that the Indians on Aruba spoke Spanish. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803.Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: Diario, Bon Dia, Solo di Pueblo and Awe Mainta and two in English : Aruba Today and The News. Amigoe is the newspaper published in Dutch.Aruba also has 18 radio stations (2 AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).InfrastructureArubas Beatrix International Airport is located near Oranjestad. This airport has daily flights to various cities across the United States, to San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Washington DC; New York City; and Boston, Massachusetts. It also connects Aruba with Toronto, Ontario, and South America, with daily flights to the international airports of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Germany, France, Spain, U.K and most of Europe through the Airport in the Netherlands. Direct flights from Italy started in November 2008.According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, of which 61% were Americans.In cooperation with the United States government, and for the facilitation for the passengers that arrive into the United States, the States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since February 1, 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport, United States and Aruba have the agreement since 1986 that begins as a USDA and Customs post, and since 2008, the only island to have this service for private flights. In 1999, the Department of Defense established a Forward Operating Location (FOL) at the airport.Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad. The Port of Playa welcomes all the cruise-ship lines, including Royal Caribbean, Cruise Lines, NCL, America Line, Cruise Line and many more; an estimated almost one million tourists enter in this port per year, Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government is the authority in these seaports.Arubas public buses transportation services is in charge of Arubus, a government based company which operates from 3:30am until 12:30am 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide the transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.Aruba also counts two telecommunications providers, Setar the government based company and Digicel Irish ownership company based in Jamaica. Setar is the provider of services such as Internet, video conference, GSM wireless tech and land lines and offer the latest in telecom services, Digicel is the Setar competitor in wireless technology using the GSM platform.Utilities on the islandWater-en Energiebedrijf (W.E.B.)

Angola
footnote7                   Angola, officially the Republic of Angola (, ;(This is the pronunciation in Portugal; in Angola it is pronounced as it is written) Kikongo, Kimbundu, Umbundu: Repubilika ya Ngola), is a country in south-central Africa bordered by Namibia on the south, the Republic of the Congo on the north, and Zambia on the east; its west coast is on the Ocean with Luanda as its capital city. The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.The Portuguese were present in somemostly coastalpoints of the territory of what is now Angola, from the 16th to the 19th century, interacting in diverse ways with the peoples that lived there. In the 19th century they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. Angola as a Portuguese colony was not established before the end of the 19th century, and effective occupation, as required by the Conference (1884) was achieved in the 1920s as with most African colonies. After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense civil war from 1975 to 2002. The country has vast mineral and petroleum reserves; however, its expectancy and mortality rates are both among the worst-ranked in the world.(  Life expectancy at birth www.cia.gov (2009))EtymologyThe name Angola comes from the Portuguese colonial name Reino de Angola, appearing as early as de Novaiss 1571 charter.(Heywood, Linda M. & Thornton, John K. Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the foundation of the Americas, 1585-1660, p. 82. Cambridge University Press, 2007.) The toponym was erroneously derived by the Portuguese from the Mbundu title ngola held by the king or warrior-chief kia Ndambi of the Ndongo. Ndongo was a state in the highlands between the Kwanza and Rivers nominally tributary to the king of Kongo but which was seeking greater independence during the 16th century. History  Early migrations and political units Khoisan hunter-gatherers are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area. They were largely replaced by Bantu tribes during the Bantu migrations, though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day. The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day Republic of Cameroon. When they reached what is now Angola, they encountered the Khoisan, Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced than themselves, whom they easily dominated with their superior knowledge of metal-working, ceramics and agriculture. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics.During this period of time, the Bantu established a number of political units (kingdoms, empires) in most parts of what today is Angola. The best known of these is the of the Kongo that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included important regions in the west of present day Republic of the Congo and of Congo as well as in southern Gabon.  It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilizations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the Zimbabwe Empire, but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.() Portuguese presence on the coast File:Bay_of_Luanda.jpg|thumb|left|280px|View from de Luanda to the bay of Luanda, Angolas capital city and economic and commercial hub, 2008.The geographical areas now designated as Angola entered into contact with the Portuguese in the late 15th century, concretely in 1483, when Portugal established relations with the Kongo State, which stretched from modern Gabon in the north to the River in the south. In this context, they established a small trade post at the port of Mpinda, in Soyo. The Portuguese explorer Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as So Paulo de Loanda, with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. Benguela, a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled. The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of current-day Angola, which relied on slave trade, commerce in raw materials, and exchange of goods for survival. The slave trade provided a large number of black slaves to Europeans and their African agents. For example, in what is now Angola, the Imbangala economy was heavily focused on the slave trade.()()File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|Nzinga in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in Luanda, 1657.European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves. Within the Empire, most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations. This trade would last until the first half of the 19th century. According to John Iliffe, Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys.(John Iliffe (2007) Africans: the history of a continent. Cambridge University Press. p.68. ISBN 0521682975)The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars forming the Portuguese colony of Angola. Taking advantage of the Restoration War, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1641 to 1648, where they allied with local peoples, consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance. In 1648, a fleet under the command of de S retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories, which restored Portugal to its former possessions by 1650. Treaties regulated relations with Kongo in 1649 and Njingas Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo in 1656. The conquest of Andongo in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda outwards, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Portugal also expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela to some extent, but until the 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited, and Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization. Delimitation and occupation of Angola The process resulted in few gains until the 1880s. Development of the hinterland began after the Conference in 1885 fixed the colonys borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced labour systems. Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not occur until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1951, the colony was designated as an overseas province, called Province of Angola. Portugal had a presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and the populations initial reaction to calls for independence was scarce. More overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s, instigated by the USSR, and began to make organised demands for self determination, especially in international forums such as the Movement.The Portuguese regime, meanwhile, refused to accede to the demands for independence, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola. The war came to be known as the Colonial War. In this struggle, the principal protagonists were the MPLA (Movement for the Liberation of Angola), founded in 1956, the FNLA (Front for the Liberation of Angola), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA (Union for the Total Independence of Angola), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict that lead to the weakening of all the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the 1974 coup dtat in Lisbon, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by Caetano.Portugals new revolutionary leaders began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted its former colonies independence abroad. In Angola, a fight for the conquest of power broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese refugeesthe retornados.(Dismantling the Portuguese Empire, Magazine (Monday, July 07, 1975))The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, and succeeded in agreeing, on paper, to form a common government, but in the end non of them respected the commitments made, and the issue was resolved by military force. Independence and civil war After independence in November 1975, Angola faced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and refugees.(The Decolonization of Portuguese Africa: Metropolitan Revolution and the Dissolution of Empire by Norrie MacQueen  Mozambique since Independence: Confronting Leviathan by Margaret Hall, Tom Young  Author of Review: Stuart A. Notholt African Affairs, Vol. 97, No. 387 (Apr., 1998), pp. 276278, JSTOR) Following negotiations held in Portugal, itself under severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the April 1974 revolution, Angolas three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975.Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA were fighting each other and the country was well on its way to being divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The superpowers were quickly drawn into the conflict, which became a flash point for the War. The States, Republic of Congo (DRC) and Africa supported the FNLA and UNITA.()() The Union and Cuba supported the MPLA.During most of this period, 19751990, the MPLA organised and maintained a socialist regime. Despite the ongoing civil war, the model functioned to a certain degree, although it was foreseeable that it would eventually fail in face of UNITA opposition.(M.R. Bhagavan, Angolas Political Economy 19751985, Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1986.) Ceasefire with UNITA On February 22, 2002, after the MPLA regime come to terms with the USA, Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, was killed in combat with government troops. A cease-fire was reached by the two factions shortly afterwards. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party, although in the knowledge that in the present regime a legitimate democratic election is impossible. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize, President Dos Santos has so far refused to institute regular democratic processes, UNITA head officials being given senior positions in top level companies. Among Angolas major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of minefields, the continuation of the political, and to a much lesser degree, military activities in favour of the independence of the northern exclave of Cabinda, carried out in the context of the protracted Conflict by the  para a Libertao do Enclave de Cabinda, but most of all, the dilapidation of the countrys rich mineral resources by the regime. While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so called Musseques, the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.(Lari (2004), Human Rights Watch (2005)) Politics File:Embassy of Angola (Washington, D.C.).JPG|thumb|Embassy of Angola in D.C.Angolas motto is Virtus Unita Fortior, a Latin phrase meaning Virtue is stronger when united. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until 2010, despite statutory authorization.After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character.(See Didier Pclard (ed.), LAngola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions, special issue of Politique africains (Paris), 110, 2008.)Parliamentary elections held on 5 September 2008, announced MPLA as the winning party with 81% of votes. The closest opposition party was UNITA with 10%. These elections were the first since 1992 and were described as only partly free but certainly not as fair.() A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists  all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.()Angola scored poorly on the 2008 Index of African Governance. It was ranked 44 from 48 African countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.()The new constitution, adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime. In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and vice-president of Angola.(In this manner, Eduardo dos Santos is now finally in a legal situation. As he had obtained a relative, but not the absolute majority of votes in the 1992 presidential election, a second roundopposing him to Savimbiwas constitutionally necessary to make his election effective, but he preferred never to hold this second round.) Through a variety of mechanisms, the state president controls all the other organs of the state, so that the principle of the division of power is not maintained. As a consequence, Angola has no longer a presidential system, in the sense of the systems existing e.g. in the USA or in France. In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, its regime falls now in the same category as the caesarist monarchy of Bonaparte in France, de Oliveira Salazars corporatist system established by the Portuguese constitution of 1933, the Brazilian military dictatorship based on the constitution of 1967/69, or several authoritarian regimes in contemporary Africa.(See Jorge Miranda, A Constituio de Angola de 2010, published in the academic journal O Direito (Lisbon), vol. 142, 2010 - 1 (June).) Military File:Tazua.jpg|thumb|250px|Tazua Falls, Rio Cuango. One of Angolas richest sources of gem diamonds.The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisionsthe Army (Exrcito), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and National Air Force (Fora Area Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000. Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the of the Congo (Brazzaville). Police The National Police departments are: Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for police operations. The National Police are also developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The National Police has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 Taxation and Frontier Supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 Economic Activity Inspectors.The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganization; modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of AKM rifles with 9 mm UZIs for police officers in urban areas. Administrative divisions Angola is divided into eighteen provinces (provncias) and 163 municipalities.() The provinces are:BengoBenguelaBiCabindaCubangoNorteSulCuneneHuamboHuilaLuandaNorteSulMalanjeMoxicoNamibeUgeZaire Exclave of Cabinda With an area of approximately , the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unique in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some  wide, of the Republic of Congo (DRC) along the lower river. Cabinda borders the Republic to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, the Kuwait of Africa. Cabindas petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angolas output. Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under Portuguese rule by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.Ever since Portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the of Angola (which has employed its military forces, the FAAForas Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The Cabindan separatists, FLEC-FAC, announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of NZita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions, in a process which although not totally fomented by the Angolan government, is undoubtedly encouraged and duly exploited by it. Transport Transport in Angola consists of:* Three separate railway systems totalling 2,761 km (1,715 mi)*  of highway of which  is paved* 1,295 navigable inland waterways* Eight major ports* 243 airports, of which 32 are paved.Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the countrys roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions. Geography File:Beach of Coatinha in Benguela, Angola.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Coatinha beach in Benguela, AngolaAt ,(CIA - The World Factbook - Country Comparison :: Area) Angola is the worlds twenty-third largest country (after Niger). It is comparable in size to Mali and is nearly twice the size of the US state of Texas, or five times the area of the Kingdom. It lies mostly between latitudes 4 and 18S, and longitudes 12 and 24E.Angola is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, the Republic of the Congo to the north-east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The exclave of Cabinda also borders the of the Congo to the north. Angolas capital, Luanda, lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country. Climate Angolas average temperature on the coast is  in the winter and  in the summer. It has two seasons; dry season (May to October) and hot rainy season (November to April). Economy Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper, as well as a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the Civil War, but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge (with updated technologies), partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.Overall, Angolas economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of civil war to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.(http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html) During 20012010 Angola has the worlds biggest average GDP growth with 11.1 percent. In 2004, Chinas Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola. The loan is being used to rebuild Angolas infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the Monetary Fund in the country.()The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 percent of Angolas economy, almost all of the countrys revenue and are its dominant exports.(Economist. August 30, 2008 edition. U.S. Edition. Page 46. Article on Angola, marches toward riches and democracy?.) Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed  in late 2005 and was expected to grow to  by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC.() The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007. However, due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated -0.3% in 2009.(https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html retrieved 2010-10-24) The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.Although the countrys economy has developed very significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of civil war. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of neo-patrimonial practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of a pervasive corruption.(Anti-corruption watchdog International rates Angola one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world.) The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since 1975, but mainly during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic, and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth.(This process is well analyzed by authors like Christine Messiant, Tony Hodges and others. For an eloquent illustrating, see now the Angolan magazine Infra-Estruturas frica 7/2010.) Secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata which are about to become social classes. However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live). An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatstica has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as poor, according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%.(See Angola Exame of 12/11/2010, online http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det16943&id2000&mid.) In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies.(See Cristina Udelsmann Rodrigues, O Trabalho Dignifica o Homem: Estratgias de Sobrevivncia em Luanda, Lisbon: Colibri: 2006.) At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident, and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda.(As an excellent illustration see Luanda: A vida na cidade dos extremos, in: Viso, 11/11/2010.) In the Development Index Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.(The HDI 2010 lists Angola in the 146th position among 169 countriesone position below that of Haiti. See Human Development Index and its components.)According to Heritage Foundation, a conservative American tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is Chinas biggest supplier of oil.()Before independence in 1975, Angola was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas, coffee and sisal, but three decades of civil war (19752002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from Africa and Portugal, while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.(Louise Redvers, POVERTY-ANGOLA: Inter Press Service News Agency - NGOs Sceptical of Govts Rural Development Plans retrieved June 6, 2009)A serious structural problem of the Angolan economy are the enormous differences between the regions. This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.(See Manuel Alves da Rocha, Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial, Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigao Cientfica da Universidade Catlica de Angola, 2010.) Demographics Image:Angola population pyramid 2005.svg|thumb|375px|pyramid for AngolaAngolas population is estimated  to be 18,498,000 (2009).() It is composed of Ovimbundu (language Umbundu) 37%, Ambundu (language Kimbundu) 25%, Bakongo 13%, and 32% other ethnic groups (including the Ovambo, the Ganguela and the Xindonga) as well as about 2% mestios (mixed European and African) and 1% European (See ethnic map and CIA  The World Factbook  Angola) The  Ambundu and Ovimbundu nations combined form a majority of the population, at 62%.(As no reliable census data exist at this stage (2011), all these numbers are rough estimates only, subject to adjustments and updates.)  The population is forecast to grow to over 47 million people to 2060, nearly tripling (Forecast provided by Futures and hosted by Googles Data Explorer)It is estimated that Angola was host to 12,100 refugees and 2,900 asylum seekers by the end of 2007. 11,400 of those refugees were originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa) who arrived in the 1970s.(Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. World Refugee Survey 2008. Available Online at: http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id2117. pp.37) As of 2008 there were an estimated 400,000 DRC migrant workers,(World Refugee Survey 2008  Angola, UNHCR. NB: This figure is highly doubtful, as it makes no clear distinction between migrant workers, refugees, and immigrants.) at least 30,000 Portuguese,(Angola, U.S. Department of State. NB: Estimations in 2011 put that number at 100,000, and add about 150,000 to 200,000 other Europeans and Latin Americans.) and more than 20,000 Chinese living in Angola.(ANGOLA and reconstructing the country: Prevention made in China, PlusNews, November 12, 2008) Prior to independence in 1975, Angola had a community of approximately 350,000 Portuguese.(See the carefully researched article by Gerald Bender & Stanley Yoder, Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence. The Poitics of Numbers, in: Africa Today, 21 (4), 1974, pp. 2327. Flight from Angola, The Economist , August 16, 1975 puts the number at 500,000, but this is an estimate lacking appropriate sources.) Languages The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups plus Portuguese due to its being a former Portuguese colony. The indigenous languages with the largest usage are Umbundu, Kimbundu, and Kikongo, in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.However, in Angola the mastery of the official language is probably more extended than elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life. Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the official language is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country.There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.#In the Portuguese bridgeheads Luanda and Benguela, which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was spoken not only by the Portuguese and their mestio descendents, butespecially in and around Luandaby a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.#Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its effective occupation in the mid-1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions. The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 19611974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.(An illustration is Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, Educao e sociedade nas reas rurais de Angola: Resultados de um inqurito, vol. 2, Anlise do universo agrcola (survey report), Servios de Planeamento e Integrao Econmica de Angola, Luanda, 1974)#In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged. This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.As a consequence of all this, the African lower middle class which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language. At the same time, the white and mestio population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest. This became a political side issue, as FNLA as well as UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War.  Ovimbundu, the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings. At the same time, a majority of the Bakongo who had fled to the Republic of Congo in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original habitat, but in the citiesand again above all in Luanda. As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous. This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban populationa trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in 2013. Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of Angolan Portuguese as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil. However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant. Religion There are about 1000 mostly Christian religious communities in Angola.(See Ftima Viegas, Panorama das Religies em Angola Independente (19752008), Ministrio da Cultura/Instituto Nacional para os Assuntos Religiosos, Luanda 2008) While reliable statistics are entirely nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are Catholics, while about a quarter adhere to the protestant churches introduced during the colonial period: the Congregationalists mainly among the Ovimbundu of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West, the Methodists concentrating on the Kimbundu speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the Baptists almost exclusively among the Bakongo of the Northwest (now massively present in Luanda as well) and dispersed Adventists, Reformed and Lutherans.(Benedict Schubert: Der Krieg und die Kirchen: Angola 19611991. Exodus, Luzern/Switzerland, 1997; Lawrence W. Henderson, The Church in Angola: A river of many currents, Cleveland: Pilgrim Press, 1989) In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the syncretic Tocoists and in the Northwest a sprinkling of  Kimbanguism can be found, spreading from the Congo/Zaire. Since independence, hundreds of Pentecostal and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin. The  Muslims, practically all of them immigrants from West African and other countries and belonging to the Sunnite branch, represent only about 1%; because of their diversity, they do not form a community.  In 2011, according to the Islamic Community of Angola (Comunidade Islmica de Angola, COIA) there were more than 80 mosques serving about 500,000 muslims in Angola, and the number was growing.(O Pais, Surgimento do Islo em Angola, 2 Sep 2011, Pg 18) Arabia is at present developing an effort to enlarge their numbers, and intends to build an Islamic university in Luanda. The proportion of non-believers is significant, but impossible to be estimated. Traditional African religions exist only residually, in the main confined to some remote rural areas.In a study assessing nations levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 010 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution.(Angola: Religious Freedom Profile at the Association of Religion Data Archives Brian J Grim and Roger Finke. International Religion Indexes: Government Regulation, Government Favoritism, and Social Regulation of Religion. Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion. 2 (2006) Article 1: www.religjournal.com.)Foreign missionaries were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.()The Roman Catholic and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the New Churches which actively proselytize. The Roman Catholic as well as some major Protestant denominations provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds, farm animals, medical care and education.()(http://foodsresourcebank.org/uploadedfiles/Designations%2520Public%2520View%252009-07-07lo.pdf)() Health A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola.() Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, are common diseases in several parts of the country. Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates. Dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis, and onchocerciasis (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola has one of the highest mortality rate in the world and one of the worlds lowest expectancy. and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on Malaria, Violence and more.(Angola Surveys,) Education class.jpg|thumb|right|Children in an outdoor classroom in Bi, AngolaFile:Lwena Moxico-Angola.jpg|thumb|right|Training center in Luena, ProvinceAlthough by law, education in Angola is compulsory and free for eight years, the government reports that a certain percentage of students are not attending school due to a lack of school buildings and teachers.(Botswana. 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. of International Labor Affairs, Department of Labor (2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the domain. ) Students are often responsible for paying additional school-related expenses, including fees for books and supplies.(In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent.( Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance.( There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas. In 1995, 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school.( It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls.( During the Civil War (19752002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed, leading to current problems with overcrowding.(The Ministry of Education hired 20,000 new teachers in 2005, and continued to implement teacher trainings.( Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained, and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day).( Some teachers may also reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their students.( Other factors, such as the presence of landmines, lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health also prevent children from regularly attending school.( Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.(Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese.(CIA world factbook 2010) 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.() Since independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools, polytechnical institutes, and universities in Portugal, Brazil and Cuba through bilateral agreements; in general, these students belong to the Angolan elites. Culture Portugal has been present in Angola for 400 years, occupied the territory in the 19th and early 20th century, and ruled over it for about 50 years. As a consequence, both countries share cultural aspects: language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity). Of course, the substrate of Angolan culture is African,  mostly Bantu, while Portuguese culture has been imported. The diverse ethnic communities  - the Ovimbundu, Ambundu, Bakongo, Chokwe, and other peoples - maintain to varying degrees their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times - in Luanda since its foundation in the XVIth century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. An African influence is evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken, but is almost disappearing from the vocabulary. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of Pepetela ans Paula Ribeiro Tavares.Leila Lopes, Angola 2011, was crowned Universe 2011 in Brazil on September 12th, 2011 making her the first Angolan to win the pageant.

Economy_of_Angola
spelling              The Economy of Angola is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,(Birgitte Refslund Srensen and Marc Vincent. Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced, 2001. Page 17.) with the Economist asserting that for 2001 to 2010, Angolas Annual average GDP growth was 11.1 percent.(http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart Retrieved on January 6, 2011) It is still recovering from the Civil War that plagued Angola from independence in 1975 until 2002. Despite extensive oil and gas resources, diamonds, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have led to a very strong economic growth in recent years, but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.Historyof Portugals explorers and settlers, founded trading posts and forts along the coast of Africa since the 15th century, and reached the Angolan coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as So Paulo de Loanda, and the region developed as a slave trade market with the help of local Imbangala and Mbundu peoples who were notable slave hunters. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese of Brazil; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the Jesuits in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of Bi and Bailundo, the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area. During the period of the Union (15801640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The Dutch, a major enemy of Castile, invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including Luanda. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in sugarcane plantations of Northeastern Brazil (Pernambuco, Olinda, Recife) which they had also seized from Portugal. Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Empire.The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Meanwhile, with the of Brazil in 1822, the slave trade was abolished in 1836, and in 1844 Angolas ports were opened to foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast Empire outside Portugal, full of trading companies, exporting (together with Benguela) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born. From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastruture, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.The Portuguese discovered petroleum in Angola in 1955. Production began in the basin in the 1950s, in the basin in the 1960s, and in the exclave of Cabinda in 1968. The government granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco, in 1955.( Oil production surpassed the exportation of coffee as Angolas largest export in 1973.A leftist military-led coup dtat, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the Caetano government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. Sese Seko, the of Zaire, met with de Spnola, the transitional of Portugal, on September 15, 1974 on island in Verde, crafting a plan to empower Roberto of the Liberation Front of Angola, Savimbi of UNITA, and Chipenda of the MPLAs eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader Neto while retaining the faade of national unity. Mobutu and Spnola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for Cabinda. The Angolan exclave has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300 kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.(Erik P. Hoffmann and Frederic J. Fleron. The Conduct of Soviet Foreign Policy, 1980. Page 524.) After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to Portugal and many travelling overland to Africa. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.The Angolan government created Sonangol, a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.(Angola Energy Information Administration) After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific civil war between 1975 and 2002.1990sNations Angola Verification Mission III and MONUA spent USD1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the Protocol, a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms, a provision the Nations largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in Albania and Bulgaria, and from Zaire, Africa, of the Congo, Zambia, Togo, and Faso. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITAs exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 to 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Republic of China, and Africa. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.(Vines, Alex. Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process, 1999. Human Rights Watch.)Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.2000sAn economic reform effort was launched in 1998. The Angolan economy ranked 160 out of 174 nations in the Nations Human Development Index of 2000.( In April 2000 Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with Bank assistance, has begun with the BCI bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists. The civil war internally displaced 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.( The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.Angola produced over 3 million carats of diamonds per year in 2003,(Africa: Mining - Diamond Mining Mbendi) with its production expected to grow to 10 million carats per year by 2007.  In 2004 Chinas Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola to rebuild infrastructure.(China grants additional USD 2 billion loan National Private Investment Agency) The economy grew 18% in 2005 and growth was expected to reach 26% in 2006 and stay above 10% for the rest of the decade.ChevronTexaco started pumping  from Block 14 in January 2000, but production has decreased to  in 2007 due to the poor quality of the oil.( Angola joined the of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on January 1, 2007.(Cabinda Gulf Oil Company found Malange-1, an oil reservoir in Block 14, on August 9, 2007.(Chevrons Block 14 Offshore Angola Finds Success Again RigZone)Overviewright|frame|National GDP per capita ranges from wealthier states in the north and south to poorer states in the east. These figures from the 2002 World Bank are converted to US dollars.Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the worlds lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed  in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to  by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. Coffee production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at . Diamonds provided much of the revenue for Savimbis UNITA rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.This is a chart of trend of nominal domestic product of Angola at market prices using International Monetary Fund data;(Report for Selected Countries and Subjects, April 2006. International Monetary Fund) figures are in millions of units.Foreign traderight|400pxExports in 2004 reached US$10,530,764,911. The vast majority of Angolas exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products. US$785 million worth of diamonds, 7.5% of exports, were sold abroad that year.(99.4% of Angolas exports are oil, diamonds Afrol News) Nearly all of Angolas oil goes to the United States,  in 2006, making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the United States, and to the Republic of China,  in 2006. In the first quarter of 2008, Angola became the main exporter of oil to China.(Angola Overtakes Saudi Arabia as Biggest Oil Supplier to China Bloomberg) The rest of its petroleum exports go to Europe and America.( U.S. companies account for more than half the investment in Angola, with Chevron-Texaco leading the way. The U.S. exports industrial goods and services, primarily oilfield equipment, mining equipment, chemicals, aircraft, and food, to Angola, while principally importing petroleum. Trade between Angola and Africa exceeded USD 300 million in 2007.(Angola-South Africa trade worth over US$ 300 million per year MacauHub) From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up businesses.(Chinese karaoke fans sing Angolas praises)ResourcesPetroleumAngola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in Africa, surpassing Nigeria in the 2000s. In January 2007 Angola became a member of OPEC. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD 1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the governments budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of GDP.((OECD (2006). Page 30.)Corporation produces and receives , 27% of Angolan oil. Elf Oil, Texaco, ExxonMobil, Agip, Petrobras, and Petroleum also operate in the country.(Block Zero provides the majority of Angolas crude oil production(OECD (2006). Page 132.) with  produced annually. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). ChevronTexaco operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. SONANGOL, the state oil company, Total, and ENI-Agip own the rest of the block. ChevronTexaco also operates Angolas first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with .(The Nations has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.(Omeje, Kenneth C. High Stakes And Stakeholders: Oil Conflict And Security in Nigeria, 2006. Page 157.)Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports.(United States Congress. Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations for 1998: Hearings, 1997. Page 269.) The U.S. imports 7% of its oil from Angola, about three times as much as it imported from Kuwait just prior to the War in 1991. The U.S. Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angolas petroleum sector.(Vines, Alex. Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process, 1999. Human Rights Watch. Page 189.)DiamondsAngola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.(Angola: U.S. Must Strengthen Ties to Protect Strategic Energy and Security Interests Council on Foreign Relations via AllAfrica) Production rose by 30% in 2006 and Endiama, the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the provinces of Bi, Malanje and Uge.(Angola wants foreign investors for diamond sector, July 26, 2007. Reuters)The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. Rafael Marques, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 Angolas Deadly Diamonds report as plagued by murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations. Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angolas diamonds.(Angola to double diamond production in 2006 Afrol News)IronUnder Portuguese rule, Angola began mining iron in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angolas iron exports went to Europe and Japan.( After independence in 1975, the Civil War (19752002) destroyed most of the territorys mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.Further reading*McCormick, Shawn H.
