Alabama  is a state located in the southeastern region of the States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with 4.7 million residents in 2009.()

From the Civil War until War II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and Americans were under-represented.() Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and technology.  In addition, the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the Army and Air Force, added to state jobs.

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the Heart of Dixie. The state tree is the Pine, the state flower is the Camellia. The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.  The largest city by population is Birmingham. The largest city by total land area is Huntsville. The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists.

History



Etymology
The (people), a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Rivers on the upper reaches of the River,() served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state. In the language, the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albamo in different dialects; the plural form Alabama persons is Albaamaha).() The word Alabama is believed to have originated from the language() and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name.()  The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources.(  The first usage appears in three accounts of the de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilasso de la Vega using Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively.(  As early as 1702, the tribe was known to the French as Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivire des Alibamons.(  Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.(()()(The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common; an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin. )

Although the origin of Alabama could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning. An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican originated the idea that the meaning was Here We Rest.( This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Beaufort Meek.(  Experts in the languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.((  Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning plants or weeds) and amo (meaning to cut, to trim, or to gather).((()  The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket( or herb gatherers(() which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation( or to collecting medicinal plants.(

Indigenous peoples, early history

peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the Northeast via the River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BCAD 700) and continued until European contact.() The agrarian culture covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600, with one of its major centers being at the Archaeological Site in Alabama.()() Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Ceremonial Complex (SECC).() Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.()

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were  Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee, and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Koasati, and Mobile.()

European settlement
The French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile, in 1702.() The area was French from 1702 to 1763; part of British Florida from 1763 to 1780. Thomas Bassett was the first British settler in the state. He settled near what is now River in Washington County.() Alabama became part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 to 1810; part of the independent of West Florida for a short time (90 days); annexed by the U.S. and added to the of Orleans (1810); and, finally, added to the Territory in 1812. Throughout these later developments, however, the Spanish had kept a nominal (although largely ignored) governmental presence in the region, based out of Mobile. When Jacksons forces occupied Mobile in 1814 while preparing for the of New Orleans he demonstrated the United States facto authority over the region, effectively ending Spanish governance (though not its claim), while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf.()

The area making up todays northern and central Alabama, known as the lands, had been claimed by the of Georgia after 1763. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of the state of Georgia although heavily disputed. Conflicting claims to the area were held, first by several Native American tribes (most notably the Chickamauga-Cherokee and Yazoo), by other states (e.g. Carolina); and by the US federal government; Britain and Spain. In 1802, the region was joined to the Territory.  Individual statehood was delayed, however, by the territorys lack of a coastline.

Statehood, Civil War and Reconstruction

Alabama became the twenty-second state admitted to the Union in 1819.  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of the fertile soil. Southeastern planters and traders from the South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations expanded. The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor.( The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became farmers. The 1860 census records show that enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the states total population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 free persons of color living in Alabama at the time.

From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. In time, a Capitol building was erected under the direction of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania architect. The original structure burnt down in 1849 but was rebuilt in 1851 following the original plans.(Montgomery: History - Early Days in Montgomery, Lafayettes Visit a Local Highlight)

On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union and joined the States of America. While few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the Civil War. Alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.() During Reconstruction, the new state legislators created a public school system for the first time, as well as establishing some welfare institutions to help its people.  Alabama was officially restored to the Union in 1868.

After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.  Planters resisted working with free labor during Reconstruction and sought to re-establish controls over freedmen. In the early years the Klux Klan had numerous independent chapters in Alabama that attacked freedmen and other Republicans.  After it was suppressed, insurgent whites organized paramilitary groups, such as the Red Shirts and League, that acted more openly to suppress black voting.  Regaining power by the late 1870s, in the last decade of the 19th century, white Democrats passed electoral laws disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites.(J. Morgan Kousser.The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974) Having regained power in the state legislature, Democrats passed Crow laws, including segregation in public facilities, to restore white supremacy in the society.

In 1875, the state passed the Amendment, to prohibit public money from being used to finance Catholic schools.()

The new 1901 of Alabama effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites through voting restrictions, including literacy requirements. While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in disfranchising poor whites as well, due mostly to imposition of a cumulative tax.

In 1900, 14 Black Belt counties had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of  registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had qualified to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate.(

By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks.(Glenn Feldman. The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.) Nearly all African Americans lost the ability to vote.

The disfranchisement was ended  by African Americans leading the Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights.  The Rights Act of 1965 also protected the suffrage of poor whites.

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.() Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The population growth rate in Alabama (see Historical Populations table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920, reflecting the effect of emigration.

At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed The Magic City.  By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.()

Industrial development related to the demands of War II brought prosperity.( Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor Wallace, many whites in the state opposed federal integration efforts in schools and public facilities.

1960present
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.(

African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Rights Act of 1964,() and the Rights Act of 1965. jure segregation ended in the states as Crow laws were invalidated or repealed.()

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitutions provision for periodic redistricting based on population.  This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.(

After 1972, the states white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections.  In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.()

Geography

Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with  of total area: 3.19% of the area is water, making Alabama twenty-third in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.()  About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the River and the Gulf of Mexico. The Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the River cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.()

The states bordering Alabama are Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida to the south; and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.(  Alabama ranges in elevation from sea level() at Bay to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the Mountains in the northeast. The highest point is Cheaha,( at a height of .()  Alabamas land consists of  of forest or 67% of total land area.(Alabama Forest Owners Guide to Information Resources, Introduction, Alabamaforests.org)  Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.()

Areas in Alabama administered by the Park Service include Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.() Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead.()  Alabama also contains the Trace Parkway, the To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail Of Tears National Historic Trail.  A notable natural wonder in Alabama is Natural Bridge rock, the longest bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville.

A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the crater, which is the site of Alabamas greatest natural disaster.(Wetumpka Impact Crater Wetumpka Public Library. Retrieved August 21, 2007.)  A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.( The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (star-wound) because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.(The Wetumpka Astrobleme by John C. Hall, Alabama Heritage, Fall 1996, Number 42.) In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as an internationally recognized impact crater.(

Climate


The state is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the Koppen Climate Classification.() The average annual temperature is 64 F (18 C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.()  Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of  of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.(

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over  throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to storms and even hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

File:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the Alabama region. This is shown in this picture taken at the Old State Bank in Decatur during early January.

South Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail  the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.(Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 19902003. NLSI. Retrieved May 8, 2007.)

Alabama, along with Kansas, has the most reported EF5 tornadoes of any state  according to statistics from the Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to October 31, 2006.(Fujita scale. Tornadoproject.com. Retrieved September 3, 2007.) Several long  tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within Alley.  The state suffered damage in the Outbreak of April 1974, and the 2528, 2011 tornado outbreak.

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state.  Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state  along the Tennessee Valley  is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Alley, as distinct from the Alley of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the United States, with average January low temperatures around  in Mobile and around  in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years.  Historic snowfall events include Years Eve 1963 snowstorm and the Storm of the Century.  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is  per year.  In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Demographics

footnote  Sources: 1910-2010()



The States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2008, estimated Alabamas population at 4,661,900,() which represents an increase of 214,545, or 4.8%, since the last census in 2000.() This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.( Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.(  The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were illegal immigrants (24,000).

The of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside of the town of Jemison.()

Race and ancestry
According to the U.S. Census, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 26.2% Black or African American, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.1% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 3.9% of the population.()

The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: American (26.2%), English (23.6%), Irish (7.7%), German (5.7%), and Scots-Irish (2.0%).()()()  In the 2000 Census, 621,080 people claimed to be of American ancestry, most them are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most English Americans identify simply as having ethnicity because their roots have been in North America as long as the early 1600s. Demographers estimate that roughly 23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry.()(Reynolds Farley, The New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us?, Demography, Vol. 28, No. 3 (August 1991), pp. 414, 421.)(Stanley Lieberson and Lawrence Santi, The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns, Social Science Research, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1985), pp. 44-6.)(Stanley Lieberson and Mary C. Waters, Ethnic Groups in Flux: The Changing Ethnic Responses of American Whites, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 487, No. 79 (September 1986), pp. 8286.)  There are also many more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than are self-reported.(

In 1984, under the DavisStrong Act, Alabama established a state Indian Commission and officially recognized seven American Indian tribes, including the Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, which is a 501 (c3) group. It is made up of descendants of the Chickamauga Cherokee and others who managed to evade Removal in the 1830s. Working with University, the tribe has begun a revival of the language.

Religion
Alabama is located in the middle of the Belt. A majority of people in Alabama today identify as Protestant. As of 2000, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are Protestant, Protestant, and Catholic. The Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents in Alabama with 1,380,121, followed by the Methodist Church with 327,734 members, and the Church with 150,647 adherents.()

In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a full understanding of their faith and needed no further learning.()  In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.()()  In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 80% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian (other than Catholic,) 6% as Catholic, and 11% as having no religion at all.()

Health
A for Disease Control and Prevention study showed that Alabama was one of the worst in the country for obesity with most counties having over 29% of adults obese, except for ten which exceeded 26%.() Residents were least likely of any state in the nation to exercise.() Alabama has one of the highest incidents of adult onset diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.()()

Economy
The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, and banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. 

According to the United States of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total state product was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabamas 2008 GDP increased 0.7% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information.( full release with tables)  In 1999, capita income for the state was $18,189.()

As of September 2010, the states unemployment rate is 8.9%.(Bls.gov; Local Area Unemployment Statistics)

Agriculture
Alabamas agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and sorghum, vegetables, milk, soybeans, and peaches. Although known as The Cotton State, Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports,()() with Texas, Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three.

Industry

Alabamas industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, lumber, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and apparel. Also, Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products, mostly in the Huntsville area, location of NASAs C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the US Army Aviation and Missile Command, headquartered at Arsenal.

Most Alabamas economic growth is due to the states expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are Manufacturing of Alabama, Motor Manufacturing Alabama, U.S. International, and Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers.  Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in automobile output.()

Steel producers Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ over 10,000 people.  In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Alabama for a $3.7 billion steel production plant, with the promise of 2,700 permanent jobs.() When ThyssenKrupps new facilities reach full production capacity, Alabama is expected to become the third largest steel producing state in the country behind Indiana and Pennsylvania.(http://www.alalabor.state.al.us/PDFs/SteelCouncilNewsletter.pdf) 

Alabamas industrial and manufacturing plants includes BFGoodrich Tire Manufacturing, Materials Corporation, Refining Company, and JVC America.

Tourism


An estimated 100,000 tourists annually from other countries visit the state, including from Canada, England, Germany and Japan. In 2006, 22.3 million tourists spent $8.3 billion providing an estimated 162,000 jobs in the state.(Encyclopedia of Alabama: Alabama Tourism Department (ATD))(http://www.800alabama.com/about-alabama/alabama-news-facts/frequently-asked-questions/)()

Health

Banking
Alabama has the headquarters of Financial Corporation, Compass and Bancorp. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based BBVA in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with Bancorporation, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. Corporation, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia in 2004 for $14.3 billion. The city still has major operations for Wachovia and its now post-operating bank Fargo, which includes a regional headquarters, a operations center campus and a $400 million dollar data center. Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham, such as Superior Bancorp, ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including Management Corporation.

Electronics
Telecommunications provider AT&amp;T, formerly BellSouth, also has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham. The company has over 6,000 employees and more than 1,200 contract employees.

Many commercial technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as the network access company ADTRAN, computer graphics company Intergraph, design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure Avocent, and telecommunications provider Deltacom. Cinram manufactures and distributes 20th Century Fox DVDs and Blu-ray Discs out of their Huntsville plant.

Construction
Rust International has grown to include &amp; Gorrie, BE&amp;K, Construction and Harbert International, which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. (Rust International was acquired in 2000 by Group International, which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based Corporation in 2007.)

Transportation
The of Mobile, Alabamas only saltwater port, is a busy seaport on the of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Waterway.  The Port of Mobile is currently the 9th-largest by tonnage in the United States.()

Barge transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Warrior River useful in the state of Alabama.

Law and government

State government


The foundational document for Alabamas government is the Constitution, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the worlds longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the Constitution.()()  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabamas constitution.() This movement is based upon the fact that Alabamas constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The branch is the Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.

The branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the of Alabama. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the General of Alabama, the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries, the State Treasurer, and the Auditor of Alabama.

The branch is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the Court of Alabama.

Taxes
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are not allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, but can deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The states general sales tax rate is 4%.(Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes, July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007.) The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabamas income tax on poor working families is among the nations very highest.() Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.( Alabamas threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.(

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.()  taxes are the lowest in the United States. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabamas tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.

Local and county government


Alabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the Constitution, all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an beverage control state; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves dry; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

Politics



The current governor of the state is Republican Robert Bentley. The lieutenant governor is Republican Ivey. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat Bell Cobb. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

During Reconstruction following the Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the American Civil Rights Movement, when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Wallace, the states only four-term governor, was a  controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal Rights Act of 1964( and Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.

In 2007, the Legislature passed, and Republican Governor Riley signed, a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the State Capitol, which housed Congress of the States of America.()

State elections
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the South, a one-party system in which the Democratic Party became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election.

Developments in the 1986 Democratic primary election led to the election of the first Republican Governor in more than 100 years and started Republicans on the road to political dominance in the state.  One million voters cast ballots in the 1986 Democratic primary. The then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor, Baxley, lost the Democratic nomination for Governor by approximately 8,000 votes to then fellow Democratic Attorney General Graddick. The state Democratic partys five-member election contest committee invalidated the primary election result claiming that thousands of Republicans had illegally voted in the Democratic primary for Graddick and as a result they removed Graddick from the ballot.  The Democratic Party then placed Baxleys name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of Graddick. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger Hunt as Governor.(Stovall, Cotter, &amp; Fisher, Alabama Political Almanac, p. 260, 1995) Hunt had been nominated in a statewide Republican primary that had 28,000 participants compared to the 1,000,000 plus of the Democratic primary.  That November Hunt became the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction when he won 57% of the vote statewide against Baxley.

Since 1986, Republicans have won six of the seven Governors elections and become increasingly competitive in Alabama politics at many levels.   They currently control both seats in the U.S. Senate and six out of the states seven congressional seats.

Republicans hold all nine seats on the Supreme Court () and all ten seats on the state appellate courts.  Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994.  In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, Sonny Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Oliver Hooper, Sr.  Hornsby sued Alabama in court and defiantly remained in office for more than a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.  This ultimately would lead to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles and ultimately losing the last of the nineteen court seats following the resignation of the last Democrat in August, 2011.

Today, Republicans also hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices.  Republicans also hold six of the eight elected seats on the State Board of Education.  In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years.  However, Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.()()()

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, Windom and Ivey, the current Lieutenant Governor. Windom served as Lt. Governor under Democratic Gov. Siegelman.  Before 2011, the last time that Alabama had a governor and Lieutenant Governor of the same party was the period between 1983 and 1987 when Wallace was serving his fourth term as governor and Baxley was serving as Lieutenant Governor; both were Democrats.

In Alabama, the members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections, but the statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.()

Local elections
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.()()

Alabamas 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts.  The current split is 42 Democrats, 24 Republicans, and 1 Independent (Choctaw).(Alabama Sheriffs Association)  However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties.() Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five Alabama counties with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).()  The state has one female sheriff (Morgan) and 9 African-American sheriffs.(Alabama Sheriffs Association)

Federal elections


From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by large margins. In 1960, the Democrats won with F. Kennedy on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to Harry Byrd. In 1964, Republican Goldwater carried the state.

In the 1968 presidential election, Alabama supported native son and Independent Party candidate Wallace over both Nixon and Humphrey. Wallace was the official Democratic candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the National Democratic.() In 1976, Democratic candidate Carter from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and until 2010 comprised a longstanding majority in the Legislature; see Dixiecrat.

In 2004, W. Bush won Alabamas nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The 11 counties that voted Democratic were Black Belt counties, where African Americans are the majority racial group.

The states two U.S. senators are Jefferson B. Sessions III and Richard C. Shelby, both Republicans.

In the House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bonner, D. Rogers, Aderholt, J. Brooks, Roby, and Bachus) and one Democrat: Sewell).


Education


Primary and secondary education
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.()

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 20062007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.( In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the State of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP.()

While Alabamas public education system has improved, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabamas high school graduation rate  75%  is the second lowest in the United States (after Mississippi).(http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf)  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.(Education Statistics. CensusScope.org)

Colleges and universities


Alabamas programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are three medical schools (of Alabama at Birmingham, of Alabama and of South Alabama), two veterinary colleges (University and University), a dental school (of Alabama at Birmingham), an optometry college (of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (University and University), and five law schools (of Alabama School of Law, School of Law, School of Law, Law School, and the Goode Jones School of Law).  Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to 16 doctoral level programs.( )()

The largest single campus is the of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 31,747 enrolled for fall 2011.(http://www.wtvy.com/home/headlines/University_of_Alabama_Reaches_Record_Enrollment_this_Fall_129916513.html) University is the largest institution in the state, enrolling 29,689 students (as of 2010) across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries.  The oldest institutions are the public of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.()()

Accreditation of academic programs is through the Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE),() the on Occupational Education (COE),()  and the Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).()

According to the 2011 News and World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, University at 36, and of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).()

Protagonists


Dagny Taggart
Image:Taylor-Schilling-as-Dagny-Taggart.jpg|thumb|upright0.56|right|Schilling as Dagny Taggart in the 2011 film.
Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. However, due to James incompetence, it is Dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Dagny has three romantic relationships, each with a man of ability: dAnconia, Rearden, and Galt. Galt marks the pinnacle of everything Dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth when she imagines a man standing off in the distance, at the end of a great set of railroad tracks and all her struggles.

The essential drama of Dagnys character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it. She believes these destroyers simply want to heap burdens upon her for the sake of others, which she has the ability to carry. Like Hank, she believes they want to live, but are too stupid and incompetent to realize how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal. It is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world - John Galt - strapped to a torture machine, about to be killed by the looters (who recognize, too, that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse), that she realizes that the moral code of the looters is one of death: they recognize what is good and necessary for life, but wish to destroy it anyway.

She is a typical heroine, similar to Francon (The Fountainhead) or Argounova (We the Living).

Francisco dAnconia
Francisco dAnconia is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged, and owner by inheritance of the worlds largest copper mining empire. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart.

A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the climax of the dAnconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He attended Patrick Henry University and was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working at a young age, while still in school, proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his familys wealth and power. 

Francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the dAnconia empire to put it out of the raiders reach. His actions were designed both to trap looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover. However, he is forced to give up Dagny, knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers. He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, Hank Rearden and John Galt.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian dAnconia.

John Galt

The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of Atlas Shrugged. He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddies side of their conversations is given in the novel. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on; these men are consistently the next to disappear. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this workers true identity.

Henry Hank Rearden
Henry (also known as Hank) is one of the central characters in Shrugged. Like many of Rands capitalist characters, he is a self-made man. He owns the most important steel company in the United States. He invents Rearden Metal, an alloy stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother, all of whom he supports.

Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem. His friend, Francisco dAnconia, helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in Galts Speech. Rearden also serves to illustrate Rands theory of sex. Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Reardens virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Reardens virtues, and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire. Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, but he responds sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict, and in doing so, illustrates Rands sexual theory.

Ragnar Danneskjld
One of the original strikers, he is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar attended Patrick Henry University and became friends with John Galt and Francisco dAnconia while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. Danneskjld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the States to The Peoples States of Europe. As the novel progresses, Danneskjld begins to become active in American waters. Danneskjlds action is to restore to other creative people the money, in gold, which was unjustly taken away from themspecifically, their tax payments.  He explains this is not altruism; his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galts philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they will have enough capital to rebuild the world.

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet Hank Rearden in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an advance payment to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation. Danneskjld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a star who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of conducting the common struggle.

According to Branden, who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjlds adventures at sea, which were cut from the final published text.(Reedstrom, Karen. 1992 Interview with Full Context. Barbara Branden interview in Full Context, October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.) In the published book, Danneskjld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.


Antagonists


James Taggart
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the books most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

Lillian Rearden
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden. They have been married eight years as the novel begins. Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Reardens wife with owning the worlds most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted. Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is realistic enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. She indicates that she abhors Francisco dAnconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer.

As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction. Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed. She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value.

Lillian achieves her goal to destroy Reardens business, when she passes on information to James Taggart about her husbands affair. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign the Gift Certificate (which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to the looters) and thereby destroys his business. Lillian discovers that she can accomplish her goal to destroy the business but she can neither achieve the greatness she desires nor her goal to destroy Hanks character. She uses James Taggart for sex as victory and revenge against Hank and Dagny. This does give her the satisfaction she desires and she continues to manipulate Hank until he is finally leaves her and joins Galts strikers.

Dr. Floyd Ferris

Ferris is a biologist who works as co-ordinator at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled Why Do You Think You Think? He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

Dr. Robert Stadler
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to Francisco dAnconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on Robert Oppenheimer, whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of weapons.(David Harriman, of Ayn Rand, pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.) To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the man who knew better but chose not to act for the good.

Wesley Mouch
The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist  whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington. Later in the novel, he becomes the countrys economic dictator.

Secondary characters
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.(Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for major. Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.)

*Hugh Akston is identified as One of the last great advocates of reason. He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco dAnconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akstons name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental.

*Jeff Allen is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagnys cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company (Rands extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism), as well as a hint of John Galts true background.

*Calvin Atwood is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins Galts strike.

*Cherryl Brooks is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggarts descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Upon realizing the nature of the moral code surrounding her, the apparent lack of escape for herself and the heroes she worships, and her unnamed desire to remove support from the machinations she abhors, Cherryl throws herself from a bridge to her death after witnessing her husband James Taggart sleeping with Lillian Rearden and after being beaten for showing James his code of death.

*Mayor Bascom is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.

*Bill Brent is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*Kip Chalmers is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.

*Emma Chalmers, Kip Chalmerss mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as Kips Ma, she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the years wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.

*Dan Conway is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of Colorado, he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.

*Ken Danagger owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galts strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.

*Quentin Daniels is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galts motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagnys pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galts Gulch.

*Sebastian dAnconia was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the dAnconia dynasty. Escaped from Spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the Inquisition, leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco dAnconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.

*Balph Eubank is called the literary leader of the age, despite the fact that he has never sold more than three thousand copies of his books. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies.

*The Fishwife is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammonds grocery market; she is described as having dark, disheveled hair and large eyes, and is a writer. Galt says she wouldnt be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind. According to Branden in her book Passion of Ayn Rand, The Fishwife is Ayns Hitchcock-like appearance in Atlas Shrugged.()

*Lawrence Hammond runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.

At age 24, his opera Phaethon was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared.

*Gwen Ives is Hank Reardens secretary.

*Owen Kellogg is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in York. He catches Dagny Taggarts eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galts Gulch.

*Fred Kinnan is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galts 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.

*Paul Larkin is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down.

*Cuffy Meigs is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbits foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as impervious to thought. Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the countrys last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.

*Dave Mitchum is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*Chick Morrison holds the position of Morale Conditioner in the government.

*Horace Bussby Mowen is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.

*Midas Mulligan is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galts strike. Mulligans birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him Midas in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.

*Judge Narragansett is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant.

*Ben Nealy is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.

*Betty Pope is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.

*Dr. Potter holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.

*Dr. Simon Pritchett is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age.

*Reardens mother, whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.

*Philip Rearden is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brothers home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brothers charity.

*Dwight Sanders owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.

*Bertram Scudder is an editorial writer for the magazine The Future. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called The Octopus. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*Claude Slagenhop is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Reardens friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*Gerald and Ivy Starnes are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a pseudo-Buddhist ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their fathers company was entirely due to the workers.

*Andrew Stockton runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galts Gulch.

*Nathaniel Taggart was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud, and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters.

*Mr. Thompson is the Head of the State for the States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rands notes indicate that she modeled him on President S. Truman, and that she deliberately decided not to call him of the United States as this title has honorable connotations which the character does not deserve.

*Lester Tuck is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.

*Clem Weatherby is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.

*The Wet Nurse (Tony) is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Reardens mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.

*Edwin Eddie Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with Dagny Taggart. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the Promethean creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. He sticks it out with the railway to the bitter end, even when the old world is obviously collapsing and Dagny has shifted her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt. In the end, he stays with the broken-down Comet in the middle of the desert, like a captain going down with his ship. It is unclear whether or not the strikers or anyone else will return to save him.

*Ellis Wyatt is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brothers policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. Its yours. One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as Wyatts Torch. Later Dagny meets him in Galts Gulch.

Alaska  is the largest state in the United States by area. It is situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent, with Canada to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south, with Russia further west across the Strait. Approximately half of Alaskas 710,231 residents (as per the United States Census) live within the metropolitan area. Alaska is the least densely populated state of the U.S.()

Alaska was purchased from the Empire on March 30, 1867, for $7.2 million ($ in todays dollars) at about two cents per acre ($4.74/km). The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized (or incorporated) territory on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.

The name Alaska () was already introduced in the Russian colonial period, when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the Aleut alaxsxaq, meaning the mainland or more literally, the object towards which the action of the sea is directed.(Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. Derivation of the Word Alaska. American Anthropologist n.s., 42: pp. 550551) It is also known as Alyeska, the great land, an Aleut word derived from the same root.

Geography


Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.() It is the only non-contiguous U.S. state on continental North America; about  of British Columbia (Canada) separate Alaska from Washington state. Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States. It is technically part of the continental U.S., but is often not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called the Lower 48.(The other three exclaves of the United States are the Angle of Minnesota, Roberts, Washington and Vermont.)  The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent, but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by the Territory and Columbia in Canada, to the east, the of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Sea, Strait, and Sea to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaskas territorial waters touch Russias territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian Diomede Island and Alaskan Diomede Island are only  apart.  With the extension of the Islands into the eastern hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost.

area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Alaskas size compared with the 48 contiguous states.
Alaska is the largest state in the United States in land area at , over twice the size of Texas, the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries.
Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: Texas, California, and Montana. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.

Regions
There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six generally accepted regions:

South Central

The most populous region of Alaska, containing Anchorage, the Valley and the Peninsula.  Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the Range and west of the Mountains also fall within the definition of Southcentral, as well as the William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez.

Southeast

Also known as the Panhandle, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States, and hence was where most initial non-Native settlement occurred following the Purchase. It contains the state capital, Juneau, the former capital, Sitka, and the large town of Ketchikan.  The road systems leading from these cities are strictly local;  no roads connect these communities to each other or any other communities apart from their own suburbs.  The region is dominated by the Archipelago as well as the National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States.

Interior

File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|right|McKinley is both the highest peak in Alaska and in all of North America.
The largest region of Alaska, much of it uninhabited wilderness.  Fairbanks is the only community of any significant size.  Small towns and Native villages are scattered throughout, mostly along the highway and river systems.  National Park and Preserve is located here, home to McKinley (also widely known by its local name of Denali), the highest point in North America.

Southwest

File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|thumb|upright|bear fishing for salmon at Brooks Falls.
A sparsely inhabited region stretching some  inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. Island is also located in Southwest. The massive Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here.  Portions of the Peninsula are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

North Slope

The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the Petroleum ReserveAlaska and the Bay Oil Field.() Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here.  The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region.  However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom think of themselves as one.

Aleutian Islands

More than 300 small, volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over  into the Pacific Ocean. The Date Line was drawn west of 180 to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day.  However, because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, this makes Alaska the northernmost, easternmost and westernmost state in the union, with the southernmost state being Hawaii.  Two of the islands, Attu and Kiska, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.

Natural features
File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006 edited-1.jpg|right|thumb|Volcano erupting on January 12, 2006.
With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly  of tidal shoreline. The Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Peninsula. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. Island, for example, is home to Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to  above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japans Fuji. The chain of volcanoes extends to Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Northwest which is actively undergoing continent building.

One of the worlds largest tides occurs in Arm, just south of Anchorage  tidal differences can be more than . (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but several areas in Canada have larger tides.)()


Alaska has more than three million lakes.()() Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover  (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers some  of land and  of tidal zone. The Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers  alone. With over 100,000, Alaska has half of the worlds glaciers.

Land ownership

According to an October 1998 report by the States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as public lands, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and wildlife refuges. Of these, the of Land Management manages  , or 23.8% of the state. The National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the worlds largest wildlife refuge, comprising .

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns ;  its entitlement under the Statehood Act.  A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly-formed boroughs.  Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities, though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.  The of Alaska, as a grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another  are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Native Claims Settlement Act.  Regional Native corporation Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications.  Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect.  Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land.  Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.  Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

Climate

The climate in Juneau and the southeast panhandle is a mid-latitude climate (climate classification Cfb) in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Kppen Cfc) in the northern parts. On an annual basis, the panhandle is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over  of precipitation a year, while other areas receive over .(Mean Annual Precipitation in Alaska-Yukon. Oregon Climate Service at State University. Retrieved October 23, 2006. ) This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the regions proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives  of precipitation a year, with around  of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate (Kppen Dfc) due to its brief, cool summers.

beach.jpg|thumb|Barrow, known colloquially for many years by the nickname Top of the World, is the northernmost city in the United States.
The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation.  An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the River valley is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than  of precipitation annually.  On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around  of precipitation.(

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90sF (the low to mid 30s C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below . Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than  a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is  in Fort Yukon (which is just  inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,()() making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.()() The lowest official Alaska temperature is  in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971,(( one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).()

The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic (Kppen ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in Barrow is .(History for Barrow, Alaska. Monthly Summary for July 2006. Weather Underground. Retrieved October 23, 2006.) Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than  per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.

History


Alaska natives


Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. The Tlingit people developed a matriarchal society in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts, and the Tsimshian people, whose population were decimated by a smallpox epidemic in the 1860s. The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut peoples seafaring society, although they were among the first to be exploited by the Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the Yupik, while their cousins the Alutiiq lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The Gwichin people of the northern Interior region are primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested National Wildlife Refuge. The North Slope and Diomede Island are occupied by the widespread Inuit people.

Colonization
File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the Trail during the Gold Rush.

Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in century.( . .      XVII .? . ., 1992.  4. .6769.) According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of Dezhnyovs expedition were thrown to Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the message of Chukchi geographer Daurkin who had visited Alaska in 17641765 and reported about village on the Kheuveren river, populated by bearded men who pray to the icons. Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with River.(http://www.fartuna.ru/go.php?ad489047)

It is usually assumed that the first European boat to reach Alaska was St. Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M. S. Gvozdev and assistant navigator I. Fyodorov on August 21, 1732 during expedition of Siberian cossak A. F. Shestakov adb Belorussian explorer D. I. Pavlutsky (17291735)( . .   . //     : - .  . 3.  2000.  .   . .-.: , 1993.)

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St. Peter. After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia towards the Aleutian islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784. Between 1774 and 1800 Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Sound. These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez, Sound, and Cordova. Later, the Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

Sitka, renamed Archangel from 1804 to 1867, on Island in the Archipelago in what is now Alaska, became the capital of America and remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable.

H. Seward, the States Secretary of State, negotiated the Purchase (also known as Sewards Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a district starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the president of the United States, as well as a district court headquartered in Sitka.

For most of Alaskas first decade under the American flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.  They organized a provisional city government, which was Alaskas first city government, but not in a legal sense.  Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect.

U.S. Territory
Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska.  Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912.  Alaskas capital, which had been in Sitka until the 1900 legislation mandated its transfer to Juneau (the actual move took place in 1906, after initial questions arose), begun to take shape with the construction of the Governors Mansion that same year.

During World War II, the Islands Campaign focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands  Attu, Agattu and Kiska(these three Aleutian outer islands are about  away from continental USSR,  from continental Alaska (U.S.),  from Japan.)  that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. Unalaska/Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the U.S. Army Air Corps and Navy submariners.

The U.S. Lend-Lease program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

Statehood
Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate.  Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946.  The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaskas Constitutional Convention would soon follow.  Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska.  Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

On April 27, 1964, the massive Friday Earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides. It was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world, with a moment magnitude of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake.  The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.

The 1968 discovery of oil at Bay and the 1977 completion of the Pipeline led to an oil boom.  Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.  That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.  In 1989, the Valdez hit a reef in the William Sound, spilling over  of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,600 km) of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the National Wildlife Refuge.

Demographics

footnote  1930 and 1940 censuses taken in preceding autumn
Sources: 19102010()


The States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2008, estimated Alaskas population at 686,293,( which represents an increase of 59,361, or 9.5%, since the last census in 2000.() This includes a natural increase since the last census of 60,994 people (that is 86,062 births minus 25,068 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 5,469 people out of the state.( Immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 4,418 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 9,887 people.(

In 2000 Alaska ranked the 48th state by population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming (and Washington D.C.).() Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at 1.0 person per square mile (0.42/km), with the next state, Wyoming, at 5.1 per square mile (1.97/km). Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area, and the sixth wealthiest (per capita income).  As of January 2010, the states unemployment rate is 8.5%.(Bls.gov; Local Area Unemployment Statistics)

Race and ancestry

According to the U.S. Census, Alaska had a population of 710,231. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.7% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 3.3% Black or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 5.5% of the population.()

Languages
According to the 20052007 American Community Survey, 84.7% of people over the age of five speak only English at home. About 3.5% speak Spanish at home. About 2.2% speak another Indo-European language at home and about 4.3% speak an Asian language at home. And about 5.3% speak other languages at home.()

A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the states 22 indigenous languages, known locally as native languages. These languages belong to two major language families: EskimoAleut and Na-Dene. As the homeland of these two major language families of North America, Alaska has been described as the crossroads of the continent, providing evidence for the recent settlement of North America by way of the land bridge.

Religion
Orthodox Church.jpg|thumb|right|St. Michaels Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Sitka.
Alaska has been identified, along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon, as being the least religious in the U.S.()(Believe it or not, Alaskas one of nations least religious states Anchorage Daily News, 2008 July 13. )  According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives, about 39% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations. Protestants had 78,070 members, Roman Catholics had 54,359, and mainline Protestants had 37,156.()  After Catholicism, the largest single denominations are Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 30,169,() and Southern Baptists with 22,959.  The large Orthodox (with 49 parishes and up to 50,000 followers)() population is a result of early Russian colonization and missionary work among Alaska Natives.()

In 1795, the First Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches() gradually became established within Alaska. Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.() In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of the mitzvah may pose special problems).(http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2011/tables/11s0077.pdf) Estimates for the number of Alaskan Muslims range from 2,000(First Muslim cemetery opens in Alaska )(Engaging Muslim: Religion, Culture, Politics ) to 5,000.() In 2010, the local Muslim community broke ground on the first mosque in the state.() Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other religious communities including Sikhs and Jains.(Shri Ganesha Mandir of Alaska )()(Holi &amp; Baisakhi celebrated by Alaskan Hindus and Sikhs )

Economy

File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The Pipeline transports oil, Alaskas most financially important export, from the North Slope to Valdez. Pertinent are the pipes in the column mounts, which disperses heat upwards and prevents melting of permafrost.
The 2007 state product was $44.9 billion, 45th in the nation. Its per capita personal income for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation. The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaskas main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

Energy


Alaska has vast energy resources. Major oil and gas reserves are found in the North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins. According to the Information Administration, Alaska ranks second in the nation in crude oil production. Prudhoe Bay on Alaskas North Slope is the highest yielding oil field in the United States and on North America, typically producing about .

The Pipeline can transport and pump up to  of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaskas bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.  The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are  of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.()  Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.()


Alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low ( Arctic Ocean

File:Bitumen.jpg|thumb|Natural bitumen from the sea

Image:University of Queensland Pitch drop experiment-6-2.jpg|thumb|100px|The University of Queensland drop experiment, demonstrating the viscosity of bitumen.

Asphalt  also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid that is present in most crude petroleums and in some natural deposits, it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used.( Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org))

The primary use of asphalt is in road construction, where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create concrete. Its other main uses are for waterproofing products, including production of felt and for sealing flat roofs.

The terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance. In English, asphalt (or asphalt cement) is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils. Outside the U.S., the product is often called bitumen. Natural deposits terminology also sometimes uses the word bitumen, such as at the Brea Tar Pits.

Naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude Bitumen; its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses.(
)() whilst the material obtained from the distillation of oil (boiling at ) is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen.

Etymology
The word asphalt is derived from the late Middle English, in turn from French asphalte, based on Latin asphalton, asphaltum, which is the latinisation of the Greek  (sphaltos, sphalton), a word meaning asphalt/bitumen/pitch which some derive from - without and , (sfall), to make fall.() Note that in French, the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads.
Another description has it that the term derives from the Accadian term asphaltu or sphallo, meaning to split. It was later adopted from the Homeric Greeks as a verb meaning to make firm or stable, to secure. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (asphalte) and English (asphaltum and asphalt).

The expression bitumen originated in the Sanskrit, where we find the words jatu, meaning pitch, and jatu-krit, meaning pitch creating, pitch producing (referring to coniferous or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu-men (pertaining to pitch), and by others, pixtumens (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to bitumen, thence passing via French into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word cwidu (Mastix), the German word Kitt (cement or mastic) and the old Norse word kvada.(Abraham, Herbert (1938), p.1)

Neither of the terms Asphalt or Bitumen should be confused with tar or tars.

 Modern usage 
Bitumina3.jpg|thumb|A tanker with the name Bitumina.
In English, the word asphalt is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and bitumen (or tarmac in common parlance). The earlier word asphaltum is now archaic and not commonly used. In English, asphalt is equivalent to the British bitumen. However, asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of concrete (therefore equivalent to the British asphalt or tarmac). In English, bitumen is sometimes used as the generic term for road surfaces. In English, the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy oil,(
) while asphalt is used for the refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture shingles and various waterproofing products. Diluted bitumen (diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines) is known as dilbit in the Canadian petroleum industry, while bitumen upgraded to crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit.(
)

Bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen. The sands of Canada are a similar material.

Bitumen is sometimes incorrectly called tar (tar is a black viscous material obtained from the destructive distillation of coal and is chemically distinct from bitumen).

Chemistry

The substance is completely soluble in disulfide, and composed primarily of a mixture of highly condensed aromatic hydrocarbons; it is most commonly modelled as a colloid, with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase (though there is some disagreement amongst chemists regarding its structure). One writer states that although a considerable amount of work has been done on the composition of asphalt, it is exceedingly difficult to separate individual hydrocarbon in pure form,() and it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt, because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large.(Muhammad Abdul Quddus (1992), p.99, in ch.5 pdf)

Most natural bitumens contain sulfur and several heavy metals such as nickel, vanadium, lead, chromium, mercury and also arsenic, selenium, and other toxic elements. Bitumens can provide good preservation of plants and animal fossils.

Background
Asphalt or bitumen can sometimes be confused with tar, which is a similar black thermo-plastic material produced by the distillation of coal. During the early- and mid-20th century when gas was produced, tar was a readily available product and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac, which is now used in common parlance to refer to road making materials. However, since the 1970s, when gas succeeded town gas, asphalt (bitumen) has completely overtaken the use of tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian Sands. Pitch is another term mistakenly used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in Lake.

Natural deposits of asphalt include lake asphalts (primarily from the Lake in and Tobago and Bermudez in Venezuela), Gilsonite, the Sea, bituminous rock and Sands. Asphalt was mined at Ritchie Mines in Macfarlan in County, West Virginia in the United States from 1852 to 1873. Bituminous rock was mined at many locations in the United States for use as a paving material, primarily during the late 1800s.

Asphalt can be separated from the other components in crude oil (such as naphtha, gasoline and diesel) by the process of distillation, usually under vacuum conditions. A better separation can be achieved by further processing of the heavier fractions of the crude oil in a unit, which uses either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to dissolve the lighter molecules which are then separated. Further processing is possible by blowing the product: namely reacting it with oxygen. This makes the product harder and more viscous.

Asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 degrees Celsius (300 F).  Sometimes oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called bitumen feedstock, or BFS. Some trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm.  The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is sometimes used as a agent, although it can mix with and thereby reduce the quality of the asphalt.

History
Geological origin
Image:Puy de Poix, gisement bitumeux.JPG|thumb|right|Bituminous outcrop of the Puy de la Poix, Clermont-Ferrand, France
Naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic algae and other once-living things.  When these organisms died, their remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where they lived. Under the heat and pressure of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen, kerogen, or petroleum. Deposits at the Brea Tar Pits are an example.

There are structural similarities between bitumens and the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites.(Hayatsu etal., Meteoritics, Vol. 18, p.310) However, detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct.(Kim &amp; Yang Journal of Astronomy and Space Sciences, vol. 15, no. 1, p. 163-174)

Ancient times
The use of bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the third millennium BCE in the early Indus community of Mehrgarh where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered crops.(McIntosh, Jane. The Ancient Indus Valley. p. 57)

In the ancient East, the Sumerians used natural asphalt deposits for mortar between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship caulking, and for waterproofing.( In some versions of the of Genesis in the Bible, the name of the substance used to bind the bricks of the of Babel is translated as bitumen (see Gen 11:3). A one-kilometre tunnel beneath the river Euphrates at Babylon in the time of Queen Semiramis (ca. 800 B.C.) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent.() This must be regarded as legendary but indicative that the concept was known. The Persian word for asphalt is moom, which is related to the English word mummy. Asphalt was also used by Egyptians to embalm mummies.(() The Greek historian Herodotus said hot bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of Babylon.(Herodotus, Book I, 179)

In the ancient East, natural asphalt was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a material of higher molecular weight which is thermoplastic and when layered on objects, became quite hard upon cooling. This was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing,( such as scabbards and other items. Statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in Japan, and probably also in China.

In America, archaeological recovery has indicated that asphalt was sometimes used to adhere stone points to a wooden shaft.(C.Michael Hogan (2008) Morro Creek, ed. by A. Burnham)

Approximately 40 A.D. Dioscorides described production of asphaltos (as distinguished from pissasphalt and naphtha): (1655 Goodyer translation). The Judaicum Bitumen is a famous deposit of native asphalt seeping through diapirs at the bottom of the Dead Sea, which comes occasionally to the surface through seismic activity in blocks of up to 100 tons in weight which are more than 99.99% pure.  It was the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit, between the Seleucids and the Nabateans in 312 B.C.()
The Judaicum Bitumen is better than others; that is reckoned the best, which doth shine like purple, being of a strong scent &amp; weightie, but the black and fowle is naught for it is adulterated with Pitch mixed with it. It growes in Phoenice also, and in Sidon, &amp; in Babylon, &amp; in Zacynthum. It is found also moyst swimming upon wells in the countrie of the Agrigentines of Sicilie, which they use for lamps instead of oyle, and which they call falsely Sicilian oyle, for it is a kinde of moyst Bitumen.( translated by Goodyer (1655) http://www.therenaissanceman.org/images/DIOSCORIDES-Intro_Book_1.doc or (Greek/Latin) compiled by Sprengel (1829) http://books.google.com/books/download/Pedanii_Dioscoridis_____de_materia_medic.pdf?idJwAUAAAAQAAJ&amp;outputpdf p. 100 (p. 145 in PDF))
The Sidon bitumen is thought to refer to bitumen found at Hasbeya.(The organic geochemistry of the Hasbeya asphalt (Lebanon): comparison with asphalts from the Dead Sea area and Iraq Jacques Connan and Arie Nissenbaumb Organic Geochemistry Volume 35, Issue 6, June 2004, Pages 775-789 doi:10.1016/j.orggeochem.2004.01.015) Pliny refers also to bitumen being found in Epirus.

Early use in Europe
An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by a certain Monsieur dEyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel, and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways - principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusin of dirt and filth, which at that time made the water unusable. He expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces, the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a Parisian of that generation.() But it was generally  neglected in France until the revolution of 1830. Then, in the 1830s, there was a surge of interest, and asphalt became widely used for pavements, flat roofs, and the lining of cisterns, and in England, some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes. Its rise in Europe was a sudden phenomenon, after natural deposits were found in France at Osbann (BasRhin), the Parc (lAin) and the Puy-de-la-Poix (Puy-de-Dome), although it could also be made artificially.(. Note: different sections of Miles online work were written in different years, as evidenced at the top of each page (not including the heading page of each section). This particular section appears to have been written in 2000) One of the earliest uses in France was the laying of about 24,000 square yards of Seyssel asphalt at the de la Concorde in 1835.()

Photography and art
Bitumen was also used in early photographic technology. It was most notably used by French scientist Nicphore Nipce in the first picture ever taken. The bitumen used in his experiments were smeared on pewter plates and then exposed to light, thus making a black and white image.  It was similarly used to print millions of photochrom postcards.

Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century.  Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common dilutents, such as linseed oil, varnish  and turpentine.  Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact.  The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of a good many paintings, those of Delacroix being just one notable example.

Early use in the United Kingdom
Among the earlier uses of asphalt in the United Kingdom, was for etching. William Salmons Polygraphice (1673) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching, consisting of three ounces of virgin wax, two ounces of mastic, and one ounce of asphaltum.() By the fifth edition in 1685, he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources.( Text at Internet Archive)

The first British patent for the use of asphalt was Cassells patent asphalte or bitumen in 1834.( Then on 25 November 1837, Richard Tappin Claridge patented the use of Seyssel asphalt (patent #7849), for use in asphalte pavement,()( Writer is replying to note or query from previous publication, cited as 9th S. xi. 30) having seen it employed in France and Belgium when visiting with Walter Simms, who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to Britain.()()  Dr T. Lamb Phipson claims that his father, Samuel Ryland Phipson, a friend of Claridge, was also instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement (in 1836).( Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org)) Indeed, mastic pavements had been previously employed at Vauxhall by a competitor of Claridge, but without success.(

In 1838, Claridge obtained patents in Scotland on 27 March, and Ireland on 23 April, and in 1851 extensions were sought for all three patents, by the trustees of a company previously formed by Claridge.(()()() This was Claridges Patent Asphalte Company, formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to Britain Asphalte in its natural state from the mine at Pyrimont Seysell in France,( Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org). Alternative viewing at: http://books.google.com/books?idsQ5AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg) and laid one of the first asphalt pavements in Whitehall.(Miles, Lewis (2000), pp.10.06.1-2) Trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in Whitehall, the stable at Knightsbridge Barracks,((Comments on asphalt patents of R.T. Claridge, Esq (1904), p.18) and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from Waterloo Place to St. James Park.( The formation in 1838 of Claridges Patent Asphalte Company (with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons, and Marc and Isambard Brunel as, respectively, a trustee and consulting engineer), gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry.( By the end of 1838, at least two other companies, Robinsons and the Bastenne company, were in production,(Miles, Lewis (2000), p.10.06.2) with asphalt being laid as paving at Brighton, Herne Bay, Canterbury, Kensington, the Strand, and a large floor area in Bunhill-row, while meantime Claridges Whitehall paving continue(d) in good order.()

Indeed in 1838, there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity over asphalt, which had uses beyond paving. For example, asphalt could also used for flooring, damp proofing in buildings, and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths, with these latter themselves proliferating in the 19th century.((( (Enter asphalt into the search field for list of pages discussing the subject)) On the London stockmarket, there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from France, Germany and England. And numerous patents were granted in France, with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in England due to their similarity to each other. In England, Claridges was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s (

In 1914, Claridges Company entered into a joint venture to produce tar-bound macadam,() with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called Clarmac Roads Ltd.() Two products resulted, namely Clarmac, and Clarphalte, with the former being manufactured by Clarmac Roads and the latter by Claridges Patent Asphalte Co., although Clarmac was more widely used.() However, the First World War  impacted financially on the Clarmac Company, which entered into liquidation in 1915.(Clarmac financial difficults due to WW1 Debentures deposited The Law Reports: Chancery Division, (1921) Vol. 1 p.545. Retrieved 17 June 2010.)() The failure of Clarmac Roads Ltd had a flow-on effect to Claridges Company, which was itself compulsorily wound up,(Claridges Patent Asphalte Co. compulsorily wound up Funds invested in new company The Law Times Reports (1921) Vol.125, p.256. Retrieved 15 June 2010.) ceasing operations in 1917,()() having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture, both at the outset,( and in a subsequent attempt to save the Clarmac Company.(

 Early use in the United States 
The first use of asphaltum in the New World was by indigenous peoples.  On the west coast, as early as the 13th century, the Tongva, Luiseo and Chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphaltum that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits.  All three used the substance as an adhesive.  It is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items. For example, it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles.  It was also used in decorations.  Small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations.  It was used as a sealant on baskets to make them water tight for carrying water.  Asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean-going canoes.

Roads in the US have been paved with asphalt since at least 1870, when a street in front of Newark, NJs City Hall was paved.  In 1876, asphalt was used to pave Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, in time for the celebration of the national centennial.() Asphalt was also used for flooring, paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century, following similar trends in Europe.(

Modern use
 Rolled asphalt concrete 

The largest use of asphalt is for making concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the States. Asphalt pavement material is commonly composed of 5 percent asphalt cement and 95 percent aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so that it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing plant. There are about 4,000 asphalt mixing plants in the U.S.

Asphalt road surface is the most widely recycled material in the US, both by gross tonnage and by percentage.  According to a report issued by the Highway Administration and the States Environmental Protection Agency, 80% of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new roads, roadbeds, shoulders and embankments.

Roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics.

Asphalt is widely used in airports around the world. Due to the sturdiness, it is widely used for runways dedicated to aircraft landing and taking off.

 Mastic asphalt 
asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt (concrete) in that it has a higher bitumen (binder) content, usually around 710% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt, which has only around 5% added bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground.  Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of  and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about  thick.

 Asphalt emulsion 
A number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing the asphalt with petroleum solvents to form cutbacks with reduced melting point or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt into an emulsion. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, cationic and anionic. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry Seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low cost pavements.

Other uses

Thin bitumen plates are sometimes used by computer enthusiasts for silencing computer cases or noisy computer parts such as the hard drive. Bitumen layers are baked onto the outside of high end dishwashers to provide sound insulation. Bitumen also is used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies (primarily Molotow) to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint and/or ink, and to make the color much darker.

Petroleum production, alternatives and bioasphalt 

Naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from sands, currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the worlds supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres( (an area larger than England), giving it the second largest proven reserves in the world. The oil sands is the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to mining, although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in-situ methods. Because of price increases since 2003, upgrading bitumen to synthetic oil has become highly profitable. As of 2006 Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about  per day and was projected to rise to  per day by 2020.( The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about ,() which at a rate of  would last about 200 years.

Certain activist groups have become increasingly concerned about the global oil and change problem in recent years due to by-products that are released into the atmosphere. Most of the emissions are derived primarily from burning fuels. This has led to the introduction of petroleum alternatives such as bioasphalt that are more environmentally friendly and less toxic.

Bitumen can now be made from non-petroleum based renewable resources such as sugar, molasses and rice, corn and potato starches.  Bitumen can also be made from waste material by distillation of used motor oils, which is sometimes disposed by burning or dumping into land fills.  Non-petroleum based bitumen binders can be made light-colored. Roads made with lighter-colored pitch absorb less heat from solar radiation, and become less hot than darker surfaces, reducing their contribution to the heat island effect.(http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ EPA)

remarks             

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI,  ) is a private organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.  For example, standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe. 

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of standards developing organizations, government agencies, consumer groups, companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.(ANSI 2009 Annual Report)

The organizations headquarters are in DC. ANSIs operations office is located in York City. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.

 History 
ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the American Engineering Standards Committee (AESC). In 1928, the AESC became the American Standards Association (ASA). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI). The present name was adopted in 1969.

Prior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies:
*Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, now IEEE)
*Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
*Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
*American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers)
*American Society for Testing and Materials (now International)
had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES).
At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the of Defense or DOD) and Commerce(ANSI history- Retrieved 2011-09-27) to join in founding a national standards organization.

According to Paul G. Agnew, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else.  Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME.  An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.

In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.(http://www.iec.ch/)

Members
ANSIs membership comprises government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.(ANSI membership page, www.ansi.org/membership)

Process
Though ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institutes requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.

ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.( Value of the ANS Designation brochure)

Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.

The American National Standards process involves:
*consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties
*broad-based public review and comment on draft standards
*consideration of and response to comments
*incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard
*availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.

International activities
In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the U.S., ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.

The Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the Organization for Standardization (ISO), as a founding member(ISO founding member- Retrieved 2011-09-27), and the Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.

Standards panels
The Institute administers five standards panels:
*The ANSI Biofuels Standards Panel (ANSI-BSP)
*The Information Technology Standards Panel
*The ANSI Homeland Security Standards Panel
*The ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel
*The Identity Theft Prevention and Identity Management Standards Panel

Each of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas. 

In 2009, ANSI and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry. 

American national standards
*The ASA (as for American Standards Association) photographic exposure system, originally defined in ASA Z38.2.1 (since 1943) and ASA PH2.5 (since 1954), together with the DIN system (DIN 4512 since 1934), became the basis for the ISO system (since 1974), currently used worldwide (6, 2240, 5800, 12232).
*A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers.  The ANSI code standard extended the previously created ASCII seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code or EBCDIC).  In Windows, the phrase ANSI refers to the Windows ANSI code pages (even though they are not ANSI standards).(Microsoft Glossary) Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for languages are variable width. Since these characters are based on a draft of the ISO-8859 series, some of Microsofts symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.
*The first computer language standard was American Standard Fortran (informally known as FORTRAN 66), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.
*The original standard implementation of the programming language C was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known C.
*The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.
*The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.
*The ANSI/HI (Institute) standards used for pumps.
*The ANSI for protection is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear. This standard is commonly used for shop glasses, shooting glasses, and many other examples of protective eyewear.
*The ANSI paper sizes (ANSI/ASME Y14.1).

Other initiatives

<eecs485_article_body>

The alkali metals are a series of elements in the table. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals are called the Group 1 elements. Previously, they were called the Group IA elements, with A representing the group elements and numeral I representing the first group within the main-group series. The alkali metals include lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs)groupnote and francium (Fr).(.) Hydrogen (H), although nominally also a member of Group 1,( very rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to the alkali metals. This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table, which means that all its elements have their outermost electron in an s-orbital. The s-block also includes earth metals, plus hydrogen and helium. The alkali metals provide one of the best examples of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with well characterized homologous behaviour down the group.

All of the alkali metals discovered, are naturally occurring, although francium is the second-rarest naturally occurring element. These metals possess similar chemical properties: They are all highly reactive metals under standard conditions. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of the next member of the group, which is probably ununennium (Uue), but these have all met with failure, but, since ununennium is the first 8 element and only the first element on the periodic table that has not been discovered, it is likely to be found in the near future. Note that ununennium may not be the next alkali metal due to effects.

Characteristics
Chemistry
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its configuration, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behaviour:



The alkali metals are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They also tarnish easily and have low melting points and densities.()

The alkali metals are mostly silver-colored, except for metallic caesium, which can have a golden tint. These elements are all soft metals of low density. In chemical terms, all of the alkali metals react aggressively with the halogens to form salts. They all react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides. The vigor of reaction increases down the group. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionization energies in their periods of the table because of their low nuclear charge and high electropositivity. The second energy of all of the alkali metals is very high, thus they always form M+ cations. 


thumb|Series of alkali metals, stored in mineral oil (Natrium is sodium.)
All of the alkali metals are notable for their vigorous reactions with water, and these reactions become increasingly vigorous when going down their column in the periodic table towards the heaviest alkali metals, such as caesium. Their chemical reactions with water are as follows:

Alkali metal + water  Alkali metal hydroxide + hydrogen gas

For a typical example (M represents an alkali metal):

:2 M (s) + 2 H2O (l)  2 MOH (aq) + H2 (g)

Alkali metals form a very wide range of amalgams.()
They tend to form ionically bonded salts with most electronegative elements on the periodic table, like fluoride and chloride.

Physics
Potassium and rubidium are naturally weakly radioactive as they have naturally occurring radioisotopes ( and ) and franciums only naturally occurring isotope () is also radioactive with a half-life of only 22.0 minutes. Caesium was also thought to have natural radioisotopes before the discovery of francium, which made the group strange compared to the others.

The alkali metals show a number of trends when moving down the group  for instance: decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling point. In general, their densities increase, with the notable exception that potassium is less dense than sodium, and the possible exception of francium, whose physical properties have not been measured because it exists only in small quantities due to its high radioactivity.

Below, hydrogen is included for comparison.


()

Hydrogen

The element hydrogen, with its solitary one electron per atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not counted as an alkali metal. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule.

The removal of the single electron of hydrogen requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron from the atoms of the alkali metals. As in the halogens, only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion. compounds of hydrogen with the alkali metals and some metals have been produced in the laboratory, but these are only laboratory curiosities without much practical use. Under extremely high pressures and low temperatures, such as those found at the cores of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic, and it behaves like an alkali metal. This type of hydrogen is known as hydrogen.

Hydrogen is sometimes considered to be an alkali metal, as it, like the other alkali metals, has one valence electron; however, hydrogen rarely acts like an alkali metal, as can be seen from the data above. In fact, it is sometimes placed over lithium (due to its configuration),() sometimes carbon (due to its electronegativity)( and sometimes fluorine (due to its chemical properties).()

Ammonium ion

The ammonium ion resembles the heavier alkali metals and is considered a close relative of the alkali metals.()

History
Lithium

Petalite (LiAlSi4O10) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist Bonifcio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Sweden.()()() However, it was not until 1817 that August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jakob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.()()() This element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline.() Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name lithion/lithina, from the Greek word o (transliterated as lithos, meaning stone), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material as lithium.((()

Sodium

Although sodium (sometimes called soda in English) has long been recognized in compounds, it was not isolated until 1807 by Davy through the electrolysis of soda.()

Potassium

Potassium metal was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH), by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly discovered pile. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.() Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (soda, NaOH, or lye), not a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different.()()()()

Rubidium

Bunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by analysis. Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Bunsen and Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope. Because of the bright red lines in its spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, dark red.()()

Caesium
In 1860, Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the water from Drkheim, Germany. Due to the bright-blue lines in its spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue.()((Bunsen quotes Gellius Noctes Atticae II, 26 by Figulus: Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.)(English Dictionary, 2nd Edition) Caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically, only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.()

Francium
Francium (then known as eka-caesium, because it is below caesium in the table) was discovered in 1939 by Perey of the Curie Institute in France when she purified a sample of actinium-227, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the decay of actinium-227.(Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B. (2005-09-25). Francium (Atomic Number 87), the Last Discovered Natural Element. The Chemical Educator 10 (5). Retrieved on 2007-03-26.) Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.()

Before Pereys discovery of francium, there were at least three erroneous and incomplete discoveries.()()()()

Eka-francium
The next element below francium is expected to be ununennium (Uue), element 119, although this is not certain. The synthesis of ununennium was attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb.()()

\,^{254}_{99}\mathrm{Es} + \,^{48}_{20}\mathrm{Ca} \to \,^{302}_{119}\mathrm{Uue} ^{*} \to \ 
 \ no\ atoms

It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be useful, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of 254Es to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level, due to the rarity of the element, and extreme rarity of the isotope. However, given that ununennium is only the first 8 element on the periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet. It is also possible that, due to drip instabilities, only the lower period 8 elements are physically possible.

Regardless of what the next element below francium actually is, it will still be known as eka-francium, as it is below francium in the table.

Production
Lithium

Since the end of War II, lithium production has greatly increased. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals such as those above. Lithium salts are extracted from the water of springs, brine pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused chloride and chloride.()

Sodium
Sodium was first produced commercially in 1855 by thermal reduction of carbonate with carbon at 1100 C, in what is known as the process.(Eggeman, Tim. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Published online 2007. )

: Na2CO3 (l) + 2 C (s)  2 Na (g) + 3 CO (g)

A process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.( Sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of liquid chloride, based on a process patented in 1924.(Pauling, Linus, General Chemistry, 1970 ed., Dover Publications)() This is done in a Cell in which the NaCl is mixed with chloride to lower the point below 700 C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be formed at the anode. This method is less expensive than the previous process of electrolyzing hydroxide. Very pure sodium can be isolated by the thermal decomposition of azide.(Merck Index, 9th ed., monograph 8325)

Potassium
Pure potassium metal may be isolated by electrolysis of its hydroxide in a process that has changed little since Davy.() Thermal methods also are employed in potassium production, using chloride.

Potassium salts such as carnallite, langbeinite, polyhalite, and sylvite form extensive deposits in ancient lake and seabeds,() making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable. The principal source of potassium  potash  is mined in Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, States, Jordan, and other places around the world.()()()

Rubidium
Although rubidium is more abundant in Earths crust than caesium the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year.() There are several methods to separate potassium, rubidium and caesium. The crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)212H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Reports of two other methods are given in the literature the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.(()
For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium.() Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the  Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite.(

Caesium

The mining of pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.(()

Francium
File:Pichblende.jpg|thumb|This sample of uraninite contains about 100,000 atoms (3.3 g) of francium-223 at any given time.(|altA shiny gray 5-centimeter piece of matter with a rough surface.
Francium-223 is the result of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals.( In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 11018 uranium atoms.( It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earths crust at any time.() This makes it the second rarest element in the crust after astatine.((

Francium can also be synthesized in the nuclear reaction:

:197Au + 18O  210Fr + 5 n

This process, developed by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211,() which are then isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT).()

Eka-francium
Ununennium has not been produced yet as of .((

Occurrence
Lithium
Although lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity.( The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm),()() or 25 micromolar;()
higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near vents.(

Sodium
Owing to its high reactivity, sodium is found in nature only as a compound and never as the free element. Sodium makes up about 2.6% by weight of the Earths crust, making it the sixth most abundant element overall() and the most abundant alkali metal. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater, as well as in solid deposits (halite). Others include amphibole, cryolite, niter, and zeolite.

Potassium
Potassium does not occur as the free element in nature due to its reactivity but, in compounds, makes up 1.5% of the weight of crust and is the seventh-most-abundant chemical element.

Rubidium
Rubidium is roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite.

Caesium
Caesium is more abundant than antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, and much more abundant than mercury or silver, but 30 times less abundant than rubidium  with which it is so closely chemically associated.()

Francium
Francium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium,() is the result of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals() In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 11018 uranium atoms.()() It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earths crust at any time.( This makes it the second-rarest element in the crust after astatine.(()

Eka-francium
Ununennium has not been discovered as of .((

Applications
All of the alkali metals have very many applications, some of which are mentioned in the links below:
*Lithium applications
*Sodium applications
*Potassium applications
*Rubidium uses and applications
*Caesium applications
*Francium applications

Biological occurrences

*Lithium has several biological effects. carbonate is used to treat disorder (manic-depression) disorders as it works as a mood stabiliser, although there are side-effects, e.g. excessive ingestion of lithium poisons the nervous system, which is even more dangerous, as the lethal dose is only just above the therapeutic dose. Lithium is present in the human body at about 30 ppb.(accessdate15 February 2011)
*Sodium is an essential element for survival as its cation, Na+, is important for nerve function. Sodium is present in the human body at about 0.14%.(accessdate15 February 2011)
*Potassium is also an essential element for survival as its cation, K+, is essential for nerve and heart function. Potassium is present in the human body at about 0.2%.(accessdate15 February 2011)
*Rubidium has no biological role but may help stimulate metabolism, and can accumulate ahead of potassium in muscle. Rubidium is present in the body at about 4.6 ppm.(accessdate15 February 2011)
*Caesium has no biological role, but can replace potassium to some extent in the body due to having similar chemical properties. Thus, caesium compounds should be avoided when possible, especially those containing radioisotopes of caesium, such as 134Cs and 137Cs. Rats fed caesium instead of potassium die. Caesium chloride (non-radioactive) has also promoted as an alternative cancer therapy,() but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, when it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.(Wood, Leonie. ) Caesium is present in the body at about 20 ppb.(accessdate15 February 2011)
*Francium has no biological role(accessdate15 February 2011) and would most likely be extremely toxic due to its extreme radioactivity. If francium was not radioactive, based on trends it would most likely behave like caesium and would, it is presumed, be similarly toxic.

Precautions

The alkali metals all react with water ever more violently and thus should all be handled with great care. Of note is the toxicity of caesium because it replaces potassium. Also, franciums extreme radioactivity is a great hazard, although the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is a sphere of radius 1 mm (over 300,000 neutral atoms).()

Aruba ( , ) is a 33 km-long island of the Antilles in the southern Sea, located 27 km north of the coast of Venezuela and 130 km (aprox.) east of Peninsula (Colombia). Together with Bonaire and Curaao, it forms a group referred to as the ABC islands of the Antilles, the southern island chain of the Antilles.

Aruba, which has no administrative subdivisions, is one of the four constituent countries that form the of the Netherlands, together with the Netherlands, Curaao, and Maarten whose citizens share a single nationality: Dutch citizen. Its capital is Oranjestad. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of  and is densely populated with its estimated 103,000 people. It lies outside the belt.

History


Arubas first inhabitants are thought to have been Caquetos Amerinds from the Arawak tribe, who migrated there from Venezuela to escape attacks by the Caribs. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. Sea currents made canoe travel to other islands difficult, thus Caquetio culture remained closer to that of mainland America.

capital Oranjestad

Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations of Vespucci and de Ojeda in the summer of 1499. Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, he and Ojeda were likely guided there by natives of nearby islands. Both described Aruba as an island of giants, remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetos compared to Europeans. Ojeda also referred to the island as Oro Hubo, Spanish for It Had Gold. Gold was not discovered on Aruba, however, for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and brazilwood from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojedas tales spurred interest in Aruba and Spaniards soon colonized the island.()()

Aruba was colonized by Spain for over a century. The Cacique or Indian Chief in Aruba, Simas, welcomed the first priests in Aruba and received from them a wooden cross as a gift.  In 1508, Alonso de Ojeda was appointed as Spains first Governor of Aruba, as part of Nueva Andaluca.

Another governor appointed by Spain was Juan Martinez de Ampes. A cdula real decreed in November 1525 gave Ampes, factor of Espaola, the right to repopulate the depopulated islands of Aruba, Curaao and Bonaire.

In 1528, Ampes was replaced by a representative of the House of Welser.  Aruba has been under Dutch administration since 1636, initially under Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. Under the Dutch W.I.C. administration, as New Netherland and Curaao from 1648 to 1664 and the Dutch government regulations of 1629, also applied in Aruba. The Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as Commandeur in Aruba in 1667.

In August 1806, General de Miranda and a group of 200 freedom fighters on their voyage to liberate Venezuela from Spain stayed in Aruba for several weeks.

In 1933 Aruba sent its first petition for Arubas separate status and autonomy to the Queen.

During War II, together with Curaao, the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.  On February 16, 1942, its oil processing refinery was attacked by a German submarine (U-156) under the command of Werner Hartenstein, but the mission failed. U-156 was later (8 March 1943) destroyed by a US plane as the crew was sunbathing.(http://www.uboat.net/boats/u156.htm) In March 1944, Roosevelt briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba. In attendance were: His Excellency, Dr. P. Kasteel, the Governor of Curaao, and his aide, Lieutenant Ivan Lansberg; Rear Admiral T. E. Chandler and his Aide, Lieutenant W. L. Edgington; Captain Jhr. W. Boreel and his aide, Lieutenant E. O. Holmberg; and the Netherlands aide to Mrs. Roosevelt, Lieutenant Commander v.d. Schatte Olivier.

The islands economy has been dominated by five main industries: mining, phosphate mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), aloe export, petroleum refineries (The Lago Oil &amp; Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.), and tourism.

Politics

File:Koningin Beatrix in Vries.jpg|thumb|Queen Beatrix is the of state of Aruba
di Aruba (front).jpg|thumb|Parliament of Aruba in Oranjestad.
As a country of the of the Netherlands, Arubas politics take place within a framework of a 21-member Parliament and an eight-member Cabinet. The of Aruba is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or Parlamento) for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.()

Together with the Netherlands, the countries of Aruba, Curaao and Maarten form the of the Netherlands. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission of people from the Netherlands. There is the supervision of the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands and the setting of general conditions for the admission and expulsion of aliens.

Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the Union, though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.()()

Moves towards independence
In August 1947, Aruba presented its first Staatsreglement (constitution), for Arubas status aparte as the status of an autonomous state within the of the Netherlands. By 1954, the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.()

In 1972, at a conference in Suriname, Croes (MEP) proposed a sui-generis Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the Antilles, each with its own nationality. Mr. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a referendum for the people of Aruba to determine Arubas separate status or Status Aparte as a full autonomous state under the crown. He proclaimed: Aruba shall never accept a federation and a second class nationality.

Betico Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, a committee appointed by Croes introduced the national flag and anthem as the symbols of Arubas sovereignty and independence, and he also set 1981 as a target for Arubas independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the Nations and 82% of the participants voted for independence.

The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague to prepare a study of Arubas independence, which was published in 1978, titled Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg. At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Arubas independence was set for the year 1991.

In March 1983 Aruba finally reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for Arubas Independence, which would occur in a series of steps granting increasing autonomy. in August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for Arubas first parliament,  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was set for 1996.

This achievement is largely due to Betico Croes and the political support of other nations like the USA, Panama, Venezuela and various European countries. Croes was later proclaimed Libertador di Aruba after his death in 1986. In 1990, movement toward independence was postponed upon the request of Arubas Prime Minister, Nelson O. Oduber. The article scheduling Arubas complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process can begin again after a referendum.

Law
The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model.  Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with a Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg (of First Instance) on Aruba, a Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie voor de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba (Court of Justice of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba) and the Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).(Aruba.com) The Korps Politie Aruba (Police Force) is the islands law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.()

Education
Arubas educational system is patterned after the Dutch system of education. There are 68 schools for primary education, 12 schools for secondary education, and 5 universities in Aruba. In 2007, there were 22,930 registered full-time students.

The Government of Aruba finances the national education system, except for private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), which finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.

Arubans benefit from a strong primary school education. A segmented secondary school program includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.

Higher education goals can be pursued through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.

Aruba is also home to two schools: University School of Medicine and University School of Medicine.

Geography





Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the Antilles island arc of the Antilles. Aruba is widely known for its white, sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents, and this is where most tourist development has taken place. The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans. The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called Hooiberg at  and Jamanota, the highest on the island at  above level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at .

To the east of Aruba are Bonaire and Curaao, two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the Antilles; this group of islands is sometimes called the ABC islands.

 Climate 

The isothermal temperature of Arubas marine climate attracts tourists to the island all year round. Under Koppens climate classification, Aruba features a climate (BSh). However Aruba does not get quite as hot as other locations with a BSh climate. Temperature varies little from , moderated by constant winds from the Ocean. Yearly precipitation barely exceeds .

Economy
File:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|200px|thumb|Iguanas on a rooftop in Aruba.


Aruba enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region including a low unemployment rate. About three quarters of the Aruban national product is earned through tourism or related activities. Most tourists are from Venezuela and the States (predominantly from eastern and southern states). Before the Status Aparte (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.

The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $21,800 in 2004; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.() Its main trading partners are Venezuela, the States and the Netherlands.

spending has been a staple in Arubas history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. As of 2006, the governments debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.() Aruba received some aid from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as Arubas Financial Independence) in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year. The exchange rate of the Aruban florin has remained steady in recent years at 1.79 florins to 1 dollar.(

In 2006 the Aruban government has also changed several tax laws to further reduce the deficit. taxes have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the IMF. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007. The inflation on Aruba in 2007 was 8.7%.

Demographics
of Aruba according to the FAO in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.

Aruba is situated in the deep southern part of the Caribbean.  Because it has almost no rainfall, Aruba was saved from the plantation system and the economics of the trade.

Arubas population is estimated to be 80% mestizo and 20% other ethnicities. Arawaks spoke the broken Spanish which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.  The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, left the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean, leading to a depletion of the Arawak population. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded Aboriginals remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic Arawak heritage. Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.

Recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting workers to a maximum of 3 years residency on the island.

Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela, far more so than neighboring Curaao and Bonaire. Much of Arubas families are present by way of Venezuela and there is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.

Jewish community
Today, approximately 85 Jewish people live in Aruba.(JewishVirtualLibrary.org The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Aruba) The community officially dates back to 1754, when Moses Solomon Halevi Maduro, his wife and six children received special permission to reside on the island by the Dutch royalty. Maduro founded the main shipping company, Maduro &amp; Sons. The Jewish cemetery, which began to be used for burials by the Jewish community beginning in 1837, contains eight tombstones dating back to 1563, the only indication of a Jewish presence on the island before the 18th century.(Marks, Yehudah. Jewish Prime Minister of Aruba Orders Pair of Tefillin. Hamodia, World News, 2 September 2010, p. B42.)

The current prime minister of the island nation, Eman, is of Jewish descent.(

Culture
Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ornate buildings in Oranjestad, Aruba.
On March 18 Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.



The origins of the population and location of the island give Aruba a mixed culture. According to the Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of Sinterklaas on December 5 and 6 and other national holidays like April 30, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queens birthday or Dia di La Reina (Koninginnedag) is celebrated. Christmas and New Year are celebrated with the typical music and songs of gaitas for Christmas and the Dande for New Year, and the ayaca, the ponche crema and ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of dollars worth of fireworks are burnt at midnight on New Years. On January 25, Croes birthday is celebrated. In June there is the celebration of the Dia di San Juan, with the song of Dera Gai. Religion also has its influences; the days of Ascension and Good Friday are also two holidays on the island.

The holiday of Carnival is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like Gras, that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as Halloween and Thanksgiving Day in November.

Language

Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The official languages are Dutch and  since 2003  Papiamento. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A language spoken on Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaao, it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. Like many islands in the region, Spanish is also often spoken. English has historical connections (with the Empire) and is known by many; English usage has also grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German and French. The latter is offered in high school and college, since a high percentage of Aruban students continue their studies in Europe.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards the Portuguese roots and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. y instead of j), where others are more oriented towards the Dutch roots.

In a book The Buccaneers of America, first published in 1678, it is stated by eyewitness account that the Indians on Aruba spoke Spanish. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803.

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: Diario, Bon Dia, Solo di Pueblo and Awe Mainta and two in English : Aruba Today and The News. Amigoe is the newspaper published in Dutch.
Aruba also has 18 radio stations (2 AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).

Infrastructure
Arubas Beatrix International Airport is located near Oranjestad. This airport has daily flights to various cities across the United States, to San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Washington DC; New York City; and Boston, Massachusetts. It also connects Aruba with Toronto, Ontario, and South America, with daily flights to the international airports of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Germany, France, Spain, U.K and most of Europe through the Airport in the Netherlands. Direct flights from Italy started in November 2008.

According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, of which 61% were Americans.

In cooperation with the United States government, and for the facilitation for the passengers that arrive into the United States, the States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since February 1, 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport, United States and Aruba have the agreement since 1986 that begins as a USDA and Customs post, and since 2008, the only island to have this service for private flights. In 1999, the Department of Defense established a Forward Operating Location (FOL) at the airport.

Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad. The Port of Playa welcomes all the cruise-ship lines, including Royal Caribbean, Cruise Lines, NCL, America Line, Cruise Line and many more; an estimated almost one million tourists enter in this port per year, Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government is the authority in these seaports.

Arubas public buses transportation services is in charge of Arubus, a government based company which operates from 3:30am until 12:30am 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide the transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.

Aruba also counts two telecommunications providers, Setar the government based company and Digicel Irish ownership company based in Jamaica.

Angola, officially the Republic of Angola (, ;(This is the pronunciation in Portugal; in Angola it is pronounced as it is written) Kikongo, Kimbundu, Umbundu: Repubilika ya Ngola), is a country in south-central Africa bordered by Namibia on the south, the Republic of the Congo on the north, and Zambia on the east; its west coast is on the Ocean with Luanda as its capital city. The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo.

The Portuguese were present in somemostly coastalpoints of the territory of what is now Angola, from the 16th to the 19th century, interacting in diverse ways with the peoples that lived there. In the 19th century they slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. Angola as a Portuguese colony was not established before the end of the 19th century, and effective occupation, as required by the Conference (1884) was achieved in the 1920s as with most African colonies. After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense civil war from 1975 to 2002. The country has vast mineral and petroleum reserves; however, its expectancy and mortality rates are both among the worst-ranked in the world.(  Life expectancy at birth www.cia.gov (2009))

Etymology
The name Angola comes from the Portuguese colonial name Reino de Angola, appearing as early as de Novaiss 1571 charter.(Heywood, Linda M. &amp; Thornton, John K. Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the foundation of the Americas, 1585-1660, p. 82. Cambridge University Press, 2007.) The toponym was erroneously derived by the Portuguese from the Mbundu title ngola held by the king or warrior-chief kia Ndambi of the Ndongo. Ndongo was a state in the highlands between the Kwanza and Rivers nominally tributary to the king of Kongo but which was seeking greater independence during the 16th century.

 History 


 Early migrations and political units 
Khoisan hunter-gatherers are the earliest known modern human inhabitants of the area. They were largely replaced by Bantu tribes during the Bantu migrations, though small numbers remain in parts of southern Angola to the present day. The Bantu came from the north, probably from somewhere near the present-day Republic of Cameroon. When they reached what is now Angola, they encountered the Khoisan, Bushmen and other groups considerably less technologically advanced than themselves, whom they easily dominated with their superior knowledge of metal-working, ceramics and agriculture. The establishment of the Bantu took many centuries and gave rise to various groups who took on different ethnic characteristics.

During this period of time, the Bantu established a number of political units (kingdoms, empires) in most parts of what today is Angola. The best known of these is the of the Kongo that had its centre in the northwest of contemporary Angola, but included important regions in the west of present day Republic of the Congo and of Congo as well as in southern Gabon.  It established trade routes with other trading cities and civilizations up and down the coast of southwestern and West Africa and even with the Zimbabwe Empire, but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.()

 Portuguese presence on the coast

The geographical areas now designated as Angola entered into contact with the Portuguese in the late 15th century, concretely in 1483, when Portugal established relations with the Kongo State, which stretched from modern Gabon in the north to the River in the south. In this context, they established a small trade post at the port of Mpinda, in Soyo. The Portuguese explorer Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as So Paulo de Loanda, with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. Benguela, a Portuguese fort from 1587 which became a town in 1617, was another important early settlement they founded and ruled. The Portuguese would establish several settlements, forts and trading posts along the coastal strip of current-day Angola, which relied on slave trade, commerce in raw materials, and exchange of goods for survival. The slave trade provided a large number of black slaves to Europeans and their African agents. For example, in what is now Angola, the Imbangala economy was heavily focused on the slave trade.()()
File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|Nzinga in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in Luanda, 1657.
European traders would export manufactured goods to the coast of Africa where they would be exchanged for slaves. Within the Empire, most black African slaves were traded to Portuguese merchants who bought them to sell as cheap labour for use on Brazilian agricultural plantations. This trade would last until the first half of the 19th century. According to John Iliffe, Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys.(John Iliffe (2007) Africans: the history of a continent. Cambridge University Press. p.68. ISBN 0521682975)

The Portuguese gradually took control of the coastal strip during the 16th century by a series of treaties and wars forming the Portuguese colony of Angola. Taking advantage of the Restoration War, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1641 to 1648, where they allied with local peoples, consolidating their colonial rule against the remaining Portuguese resistance. In 1648, a fleet under the command of de S retook Luanda for Portugal and initiated a conquest of the lost territories, which restored Portugal to its former possessions by 1650. Treaties regulated relations with Kongo in 1649 and Njingas Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo in 1656. The conquest of Andongo in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda outwards, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Portugal also expanded its territory behind the colony of Benguela to some extent, but until the 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited, and Portugal had neither the intention nor the means to carry out a large scale territorial occupation and colonization.

 Delimitation and occupation of Angola 

The process resulted in few gains until the 1880s. Development of the hinterland began after the Conference in 1885 fixed the colonys borders, and British and Portuguese investment fostered mining, railways, and agriculture based on various forced labour systems. Full Portuguese administrative control of the hinterland did not occur until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1951, the colony was designated as an overseas province, called Province of Angola. Portugal had a presence in Angola for nearly five hundred years, and the populations initial reaction to calls for independence was scarce. More overtly political organisations first appeared in the 1950s, instigated by the USSR, and began to make organised demands for self determination, especially in international forums such as the Movement.

The Portuguese regime, meanwhile, refused to accede to the demands for independence, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when black guerrillas attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola. The war came to be known as the Colonial War. In this struggle, the principal protagonists were the MPLA (Movement for the Liberation of Angola), founded in 1956, the FNLA (Front for the Liberation of Angola), which appeared in 1961, and UNITA (Union for the Total Independence of Angola), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict that lead to the weakening of all the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the 1974 coup dtat in Lisbon, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by Caetano.

Portugals new revolutionary leaders began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted its former colonies independence abroad. In Angola, a fight for the conquest of power broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese refugeesthe retornados.(Dismantling the Portuguese Empire, Magazine (Monday, July 07, 1975))
The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, and succeeded in agreeing, on paper, to form a common government, but in the end non of them respected the commitments made, and the issue was resolved by military force.

 Independence and civil war 




After independence in November 1975, Angola faced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades and claimed millions of lives and refugees.(The Decolonization of Portuguese Africa: Metropolitan Revolution and the Dissolution of Empire by Norrie MacQueen  Mozambique since Independence: Confronting Leviathan by Margaret Hall, Tom Young  Author of Review: Stuart A. Notholt African Affairs, Vol. 97, No. 387 (Apr., 1998), pp. 276278, JSTOR) Following negotiations held in Portugal, itself under severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the April 1974 revolution, Angolas three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975.

Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA were fighting each other and the country was well on its way to being divided into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The superpowers were quickly drawn into the conflict, which became a flash point for the War. The States, Republic of Congo (DRC) and Africa supported the FNLA and UNITA.()() The Union and Cuba supported the MPLA.

During most of this period, 19751990, the MPLA organised and maintained a socialist regime. Despite the ongoing civil war, the model functioned to a certain degree, although it was foreseeable that it would eventually fail in face of UNITA opposition.(M.R. Bhagavan, Angolas Political Economy 19751985, Uppsala: Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, 1986.)

 Ceasefire with UNITA 

On February 22, 2002, after the MPLA regime come to terms with the USA, Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, was killed in combat with government troops. A cease-fire was reached by the two factions shortly afterwards. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of major opposition party, although in the knowledge that in the present regime a legitimate democratic election is impossible. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilize, President Dos Santos has so far refused to institute regular democratic processes, UNITA head officials being given senior positions in top level companies. Among Angolas major problems are a serious humanitarian crisis (a result of the prolonged war), the abundance of minefields, the continuation of the political, and to a much lesser degree, military activities in favour of the independence of the northern exclave of Cabinda, carried out in the context of the protracted Conflict by the  para a Libertao do Enclave de Cabinda, but most of all, the dilapidation of the countrys rich mineral resources by the regime. While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so called Musseques, the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.(Lari (2004), Human Rights Watch (2005))

 Politics 
File:Embassy of Angola (Washington, D.C.).JPG|thumb|Embassy of Angola in D.C.



Angolas motto is Virtus Unita Fortior, a Latin phrase meaning Virtue is stronger when united. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the Presidency.

Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The Constitutional Law of 1992 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review has not been constituted until 2010, despite statutory authorization.

After the end of the Civil War the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international environment, to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to operate a number of changes without substantially changing its character.(See Didier Pclard (ed.), LAngola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions, special issue of Politique africains (Paris), 110, 2008.)

Parliamentary elections held on 5 September 2008, announced MPLA as the winning party with 81% of votes. The closest opposition party was UNITA with 10%. These elections were the first since 1992 and were described as only partly free but certainly not as fair.() A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists  all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.()

Angola scored poorly on the 2008 Index of African Governance. It was ranked 44 from 48 African countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of Participation and Human Rights, Sustainable Economic Opportunity and Human Development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of different variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.()

The new constitution, adopted in 2010, further sharpened the authoritarian character of the regime. In the future, there will be no presidential elections: the president and the vice-president of the political party which comes out strongest in the parliamentary elections become automatically president and vice-president of Angola.(In this manner, Eduardo dos Santos is now finally in a legal situation. As he had obtained a relative, but not the absolute majority of votes in the 1992 presidential election, a second roundopposing him to Savimbiwas constitutionally necessary to make his election effective, but he preferred never to hold this second round.) Through a variety of mechanisms, the state president controls all the other organs of the state, so that the principle of the division of power is not maintained. As a consequence, Angola has no longer a presidential system, in the sense of the systems existing e.g. in the USA or in France. In terms of the classifications used in constitutional law, its regime falls now in the same category as the caesarist monarchy of Bonaparte in France, de Oliveira Salazars corporatist system established by the Portuguese constitution of 1933, the Brazilian military dictatorship based on the constitution of 1967/69, or several authoritarian regimes in contemporary Africa.(See Jorge Miranda, A Constituio de Angola de 2010, published in the academic journal O Direito (Lisbon), vol. 142, 2010 - 1 (June).)

 Military 
File:Tazua.jpg|thumb|250px|Tazua Falls, Rio Cuango. One of Angolas richest sources of gem diamonds.

The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) is headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defense. There are three divisionsthe Army (Exrcito), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA), and National Air Force (Fora Area Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000. Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers, and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucano for training role, Czech-made L-39 for training and bombing role, Czech Zlin for training role and a variety of western made aircraft such as C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the of the Congo (Brazzaville).

 Police 
The National Police departments are: Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing, which will provide helicopter support for police operations. The National Police are also developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The National Police has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 Taxation and Frontier Supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 Economic Activity Inspectors.

The National Police have implemented a modernization and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganization; modernization projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programs and the replacement of AKM rifles with 9 mm UZIs for police officers in urban areas.

 Administrative divisions 


Angola is divided into eighteen provinces (provncias) and 163 municipalities.() The provinces are:

Bengo
Benguela
Bi
Cabinda
Cubango
Norte
Sul
Cunene
Huambo

Huila
Luanda
Norte
Sul
Malanje
Moxico
Namibe
Uge
Zaire


 Exclave of Cabinda 

With an area of approximately , the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unique in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some  wide, of the Republic of Congo (DRC) along the lower river. Cabinda borders the Republic to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population center.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighboring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, the Kuwait of Africa. Cabindas petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angolas output. Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under Portuguese rule by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since Portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the of Angola (which has employed its military forces, the FAAForas Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The Cabindan separatists, FLEC-FAC, announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of NZita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions, in a process which although not totally fomented by the Angolan government, is undoubtedly encouraged and duly exploited by it.

 Transport 


Transport in Angola consists of:
* Three separate railway systems totalling 2,761 km (1,715 mi)
*  of highway of which  is paved
* 1,295 navigable inland waterways
* Eight major ports
* 243 airports, of which 32 are paved.

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. Whilst a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the countrys roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Progress to complete the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made in the right directions.

 Geography 
File:Beach of Coatinha in Benguela, Angola.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Coatinha beach in Benguela, Angola



At ,(CIA - The World Factbook - Country Comparison :: Area) Angola is the worlds twenty-third largest country (after Niger). It is comparable in size to Mali and is nearly twice the size of the US state of Texas, or five times the area of the Kingdom. It lies mostly between latitudes 4 and 18S, and longitudes 12 and 24E.

Angola is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, the Republic of the Congo to the north-east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The exclave of Cabinda also borders the of the Congo to the north. Angolas capital, Luanda, lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country.

 Climate 

Angolas average temperature on the coast is  in the winter and  in the summer. It has two seasons; dry season (May to October) and hot rainy season (November to April).

 Economy 



Angola has a rich subsoil heritage, from diamonds, oil, gold, copper, as well as a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest, and fossils. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the Civil War, but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge (with updated technologies), partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.

Overall, Angolas economy has undergone a period of transformation in recent years, moving from the disarray caused by a quarter century of civil war to being the fastest growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.(http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html) During 20012010 Angola has the worlds biggest average GDP growth with 11.1 percent. In 2004, Chinas Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola. The loan is being used to rebuild Angolas infrastructure, and has also limited the influence of the Monetary Fund in the country.()

The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 percent of Angolas economy, almost all of the countrys revenue and are its dominant exports.(Economist. August 30, 2008 edition. U.S. Edition. Page 46. Article on Angola, marches toward riches and democracy?.) Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed  in late 2005 and was expected to grow to  by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. In December 2006, Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC.() The economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007. However, due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated -0.3% in 2009.(https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html retrieved 2010-10-24) The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.


Although the countrys economy has developed very significantly since achieving political stability in 2002, mainly thanks to the fast-rising earnings of the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of civil war. However, high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism, of neo-patrimonial practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military, and economic apparatuses, and of a pervasive corruption.(Anti-corruption watchdog International rates Angola one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world.) The main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted since 1975, but mainly during the last decades, around the political, administrative, economic, and military power holders, which has accumulated (and continues accumulating) enormous wealth.(This process is well analyzed by authors like Christine Messiant, Tony Hodges and others. For an eloquent illustrating, see now the Angolan magazine Infra-Estruturas frica 7/2010.) Secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata which are about to become social classes. However, overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor, but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live). An inquiry carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatstica has it that in the rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as poor, according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, while the overall rate is 37%.(See Angola Exame of 12/11/2010, online http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det16943&amp;id2000&amp;mid.) In the cities, a majority of families, well beyond those officially classified as poor, have to adopt a variety of survival strategies.(See Cristina Udelsmann Rodrigues, O Trabalho Dignifica o Homem: Estratgias de Sobrevivncia em Luanda, Lisbon: Colibri: 2006.) At the same time, in urban areas social inequality is most evident, and assumes extreme forms in the capital, Luanda.(As an excellent illustration see Luanda: A vida na cidade dos extremos, in: Viso, 11/11/2010.) In the Development Index Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group.(The HDI 2010 lists Angola in the 146th position among 169 countriesone position below that of Haiti. See Human Development Index and its components.)


According to Heritage Foundation, a conservative American tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is Chinas biggest supplier of oil.()

Before independence in 1975, Angola was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas, coffee and sisal, but three decades of civil war (19752002) destroyed the fertile countryside, leaving it littered with landmines and driving millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from Africa and Portugal, while more than 90 percent of farming is done at family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.(Louise Redvers, POVERTY-ANGOLA: Inter Press Service News Agency - NGOs Sceptical of Govts Rural Development Plans retrieved June 6, 2009)

A serious structural problem of the Angolan economy are the enormous differences between the regions. This is best illustrated by the fact that about one third of the economic activities is concentrated in Luanda and the neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior are characterized by stagnation and even regression.(See Manuel Alves da Rocha, Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial, Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigao Cientfica da Universidade Catlica de Angola, 2010.)

 Demographics 

Image:Angola population pyramid 2005.svg|thumb|375px|pyramid for Angola


Angolas population is estimated  to be 18,498,000 (2009).() It is composed of Ovimbundu (language Umbundu) 37%, Ambundu (language Kimbundu) 25%, Bakongo 13%, and 32% other ethnic groups (including the Ovambo, the Ganguela and the Xindonga) as well as about 2% mestios (mixed European and African) and 1% European (See ethnic map and CIA  The World Factbook  Angola) The  Ambundu and Ovimbundu nations combined form a majority of the population, at 62%.(As no reliable census data exist at this stage (2011), all these numbers are rough estimates only, subject to adjustments and updates.)  The population is forecast to grow to over 47 million people to 2060, nearly tripling (Forecast provided by Futures and hosted by Googles Data Explorer)

It is estimated that Angola was host to 12,100 refugees and 2,900 asylum seekers by the end of 2007. 11,400 of those refugees were originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa) who arrived in the 1970s.(Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. World Refugee Survey 2008. Available Online at: http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id2117. pp.37) As of 2008 there were an estimated 400,000 DRC migrant workers,(World Refugee Survey 2008  Angola, UNHCR. NB: This figure is highly doubtful, as it makes no clear distinction between migrant workers, refugees, and immigrants.) at least 30,000 Portuguese,(Angola, U.S. Department of State. NB: Estimations in 2011 put that number at 100,000, and add about 150,000 to 200,000 other Europeans and Latin Americans.) and more than 20,000 Chinese living in Angola.(ANGOLA and reconstructing the country: Prevention made in China, PlusNews, November 12, 2008) Prior to independence in 1975, Angola had a community of approximately 350,000 Portuguese.(See the carefully researched article by Gerald Bender &amp; Stanley Yoder, Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence. The Poitics of Numbers, in: Africa Today, 21 (4), 1974, pp. 2327. Flight from Angola, The Economist , August 16, 1975 puts the number at 500,000, but this is an estimate lacking appropriate sources.)

 Languages 


The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups plus Portuguese due to its being a former Portuguese colony. The indigenous languages with the largest usage are Umbundu, Kimbundu, and Kikongo, in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.

However, in Angola the mastery of the official language is probably more extended than elsewhere in Africa, and this certainly applies to its use in everyday life. Moreover, and above all, the proportion of native (or near native) speakers of the official language is no doubt considerably higher than in any other African country.

There are three intertwined historical reasons for this situation.
#In the Portuguese bridgeheads Luanda and Benguela, which existed on the coast of what today is Angola since the 15th and 16th century, respectively, Portuguese was spoken not only by the Portuguese and their mestio descendents, butespecially in and around Luandaby a significant number of Africans, although these always remained native speakers of their local African language.
#Since the Portuguese conquest of the present territory of Angola, and especially since its effective occupation in the mid-1920s, schooling in Portuguese was slowly developed by the colonial state as well as by Catholic and Protestant missions. The rhythm of this expansion was considerably accelerated during the late colonial period, 19611974, so that by the end of the colonial period children all over the territory (with relatively few exceptions) had at least some access to the Portuguese language.(An illustration is Franz-Wilhelm Heimer, Educao e sociedade nas reas rurais de Angola: Resultados de um inqurito, vol. 2, Anlise do universo agrcola (survey report), Servios de Planeamento e Integrao Econmica de Angola, Luanda, 1974)
#In the same late colonial period, the legal discrimination of the black population was abolished, and the state apparatus in fields like health, education, social work, and rural development was enlarged. This entailed a significant increase in jobs for Africans, under the condition that they spoke Portuguese.

As a consequence of all this, the African lower middle class which at that stage formed in Luanda and other cities began to often prevent their children from learning the local African language, in order to guarantee that they learned Portuguese as their native language. At the same time, the white and mestio population, where some knowledge of African languages could previously often been found, neglected this aspect more and more, to the point of frequently ignoring it totally.
After independence, these tendencies continued, and were even strengthened, under the rule of the MPLA which has its main social roots exactly in those social segments where the mastery of Portuguese as well as the proportion of native Portuguese speakers was highest. This became a political side issue, as FNLA as well as UNITA, given their regional constituencies, came out in favour of a greater attention to the African languages, and as the FNLA favoured French over Portuguese.

The dynamics of the language situation, as described above, were additionally fostered by the massive migrations triggered by the Civil War.  Ovimbundu, the most populous ethnic group and the most affected by the war, appeared in great numbers in urban areas outside their areas, especially in Luanda and surroundings. At the same time, a majority of the Bakongo who had fled to the Republic of Congo in the early 1960s, or of their children and grandchildren, returned to Angola, but mostly did not settle in their original habitat, but in the citiesand again above all in Luanda. As a consequence, more than half the population is now living in the cities which, from the linguistic point of view, have become highly heterogeneous. This means, of course, that Portuguese as the overall language of communication is by now of paramount importance, and that the role of the African languages is steadily decreasing among the urban populationa trend which is beginning to spread into rural areas as well.

The exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, although a census is expected to be carried out in 2013. Quite a number of voices demand the recognition of Angolan Portuguese as a specific variant, comparable to those spoken in Portugal or in Brazil. However, while there exists a certain number of idiomatic particularities in everyday Portuguese, as spoken by Angolans, it remains to be seen whether or not the Angolan government comes to the conclusion that these particularities constitute a configuration that justifies the claim to be a new language variant.

 Religion 



There are about 1000 mostly Christian religious communities in Angola.(See Ftima Viegas, Panorama das Religies em Angola Independente (19752008), Ministrio da Cultura/Instituto Nacional para os Assuntos Religiosos, Luanda 2008) While reliable statistics are entirely nonexistent, estimates have it that more than half of the population are Catholics, while about a quarter adhere to the protestant churches introduced during the colonial period: the Congregationalists mainly among the Ovimbundu of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its West, the Methodists concentrating on the Kimbundu speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje, the Baptists almost exclusively among the Bakongo of the Northwest (now massively present in Luanda as well) and dispersed Adventists, Reformed and Lutherans.(Benedict Schubert: Der Krieg und die Kirchen: Angola 19611991. Exodus, Luzern/Switzerland, 1997; Lawrence W. Henderson, The Church in Angola: A river of many currents, Cleveland: Pilgrim Press, 1989) In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the syncretic Tocoists and in the Northwest a sprinkling of  Kimbanguism can be found, spreading from the Congo/Zaire. Since independence, hundreds of Pentecostal and similar communities have sprung up in the cities, where by now about 50% of the population is living; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin. The  Muslims, practically all of them immigrants from West African and other countries and belonging to the Sunnite branch, represent only about 1%; because of their diversity, they do not form a community.  In 2011, according to the Islamic Community of Angola (Comunidade Islmica de Angola, COIA) there were more than 80 mosques serving about 500,000 muslims in Angola, and the number was growing.(O Pais, Surgimento do Islo em Angola, 2 Sep 2011, Pg 18) Arabia is at present developing an effort to enlarge their numbers, and intends to build an Islamic university in Luanda. The proportion of non-believers is significant, but impossible to be estimated. Traditional African religions exist only residually, in the main confined to some remote rural areas.

In a study assessing nations levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 010 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution, Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion, 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion, 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution.(Angola: Religious Freedom Profile at the Association of Religion Data Archives Brian J Grim and Roger Finke. International Religion Indexes: Government Regulation, Government Favoritism, and Social Regulation of Religion. Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion. 2 (2006) Article 1: www.religjournal.com.)

Foreign missionaries were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.()

The Roman Catholic and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the New Churches which actively proselytize. The Roman Catholic as well as some major Protestant denominations provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds, farm animals, medical care and education.()(http://foodsresourcebank.org/uploadedfiles/Designations%2520Public%2520View%252009-07-07lo.pdf)()

 Health 

A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola.() Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, are common diseases in several parts of the country. Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates. Dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis, and onchocerciasis (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola has one of the highest mortality rate in the world and one of the worlds lowest expectancy. and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on Malaria, Violence and more.(Angola Surveys,)

 Education

Although by law, education in Angola is compulsory and free for eight years, the government reports that a certain percentage of students are not attending school due to a lack of school buildings and teachers.(Botswana. 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. of International Labor Affairs, Department of Labor (2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the domain. ) Students are often responsible for paying additional school-related expenses, including fees for books and supplies.(

In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent.( Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance.( There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas. In 1995, 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school.( It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls.( During the Civil War (19752002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed, leading to current problems with overcrowding.(

The Ministry of Education hired 20,000 new teachers in 2005, and continued to implement teacher trainings.( Teachers tend to be underpaid, inadequately trained, and overworked (sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day).( Some teachers may also reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their students.( Other factors, such as the presence of landmines, lack of resources and identity papers, and poor health also prevent children from regularly attending school.( Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004, the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded.(

Literacy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese.(CIA world factbook 2010) 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.() Since independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools, polytechnical institutes, and universities in Portugal, Brazil and Cuba through bilateral agreements; in general, these students belong to the Angolan elites.

 Culture 



Portugal has been present in Angola for 400 years, occupied the territory in the 19th and early 20th century, and ruled over it for about 50 years. As a consequence, both countries share cultural aspects: language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholic Christianity). Of course, the substrate of Angolan culture is African,  mostly Bantu, while Portuguese culture has been imported. The diverse ethnic communities  - the Ovimbundu, Ambundu, Bakongo, Chokwe, and other peoples - maintain to varying degrees their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times - in Luanda since its foundation in the XVIth century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. An African influence is evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken, but is almost disappearing from the vocabulary. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of Pepetela ans Paula Ribeiro Tavares.

Leila Lopes, Angola 2011, was crowned Universe 2011 in Brazil on September 12th, 2011 making her the first Angolan to win the pageant.

The Economy of Angola is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,(Birgitte Refslund Srensen and Marc Vincent. Caught Between Borders: Response Strategies of the Internally Displaced, 2001. Page 17.) with the Economist asserting that for 2001 to 2010, Angolas Annual average GDP growth was 11.1 percent.(http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart Retrieved on January 6, 2011) It is still recovering from the Civil War that plagued Angola from independence in 1975 until 2002. Despite extensive oil and gas resources, diamonds, hydroelectric potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the country has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have led to a very strong economic growth in recent years, but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.

History
of Portugals explorers and settlers, founded trading posts and forts along the coast of Africa since the 15th century, and reached the Angolan coast in the 16th century. Portuguese explorer Dias de Novais founded Luanda in 1575 as So Paulo de Loanda, and the region developed as a slave trade market with the help of local Imbangala and Mbundu peoples who were notable slave hunters. Trade was mostly with the Portuguese of Brazil; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the ports of Luanda and Benguela. By this time, Angola, a Portuguese colony, was in fact like a colony of Brazil, paradoxically another Portuguese colony. A strong Brazilian influence was also exercised by the Jesuits in religion and education. War gradually gave way to the philosophy of trade. The great trade routes and the agreements that made them possible were the driving force for activities between the different areas; warlike states become states ready to produce and to sell. In the Planalto (the high plains), the most important states were those of Bi and Bailundo, the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. The colonial power, Portugal, becoming ever richer and more powerful, would not tolerate the growth of these neighbouring states and subjugated them one by one, so that by the beginning of this century the Portuguese had complete control over the entire area. During the period of the Union (15801640), Portugal lost influence and power and made new enemies. The Dutch, a major enemy of Castile, invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions, including Luanda. The Dutch ruled Luanda from 1640 to 1648 as Fort Aardenburgh. They were seeking black slaves for use in sugarcane plantations of Northeastern Brazil (Pernambuco, Olinda, Recife) which they had also seized from Portugal. Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Empire.

The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Meanwhile, with the of Brazil in 1822, the slave trade was abolished in 1836, and in 1844 Angolas ports were opened to foreign shipping. By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast Empire outside Portugal, full of trading companies, exporting (together with Benguela) palm and peanut oil, wax, copal, timber, ivory, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, among many other products. Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be produced locally. The Angolan bourgeoisie was born. From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastruture, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.

The Portuguese discovered petroleum in Angola in 1955. Production began in the basin in the 1950s, in the basin in the 1960s, and in the exclave of Cabinda in 1968. The government granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco, in 1955.( Oil production surpassed the exportation of coffee as Angolas largest export in 1973.



A leftist military-led coup dtat, started on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, overthrew the Caetano government in Portugal, and promised to hand over power to an independent Angolan government. Sese Seko, the of Zaire, met with de Spnola, the transitional of Portugal, on September 15, 1974 on island in Verde, crafting a plan to empower Roberto of the Liberation Front of Angola, Savimbi of UNITA, and Chipenda of the MPLAs eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader Neto while retaining the faade of national unity. Mobutu and Spnola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for Cabinda. The Angolan exclave has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300 kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.(Erik P. Hoffmann and Frederic J. Fleron. The Conduct of Soviet Foreign Policy, 1980. Page 524.) After independence thousands of white Portuguese left, most of them to Portugal and many travelling overland to Africa. There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.

The Angolan government created Sonangol, a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.(Angola Energy Information Administration) After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific civil war between 1975 and 2002.

1990s
Nations Angola Verification Mission III and MONUA spent USD1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the Protocol, a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited UNITA from buying foreign arms, a provision the Nations largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in Albania and Bulgaria, and from Zaire, Africa, of the Congo, Zambia, Togo, and Faso. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITAs exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 to 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Republic of China, and Africa. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.(Vines, Alex. Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process, 1999. Human Rights Watch.)

Despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998, the economy grew by an estimated 4% in 1999. The government introduced new currency denominations in 1999, including a 1 and 5 kwanza note.

2000s
An economic reform effort was launched in 1998. The Angolan economy ranked 160 out of 174 nations in the Nations Human Development Index of 2000.( In April 2000 Angola started an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with Bank assistance, has begun with the BCI bank. Nevertheless, a legacy of fiscal mismanagement and corruption persists. The civil war internally displaced 3.8 million people, 32% of the population, by 2001.( The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons, thus resulting in large-scale increases in agriculture production.

Angola produced over 3 million carats of diamonds per year in 2003,(Africa: Mining - Diamond Mining Mbendi) with its production expected to grow to 10 million carats per year by 2007.  In 2004 Chinas Eximbank approved a $2 billion line of credit to Angola to rebuild infrastructure.(China grants additional USD 2 billion loan National Private Investment Agency) The economy grew 18% in 2005 and growth was expected to reach 26% in 2006 and stay above 10% for the rest of the decade.

ChevronTexaco started pumping  from Block 14 in January 2000, but production has decreased to  in 2007 due to the poor quality of the oil.( Angola joined the of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on January 1, 2007.(

Cabinda Gulf Oil Company found Malange-1, an oil reservoir in Block 14, on August 9, 2007.(Chevrons Block 14 Offshore Angola Finds Success Again RigZone)

Overview

right|frame|National GDP per capita ranges from wealthier states in the north and south to poorer states in the east. These figures from the 2002 World Bank are converted to US dollars.
Despite its abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the worlds lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed  in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to  by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group, a conglomerate which is owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs in building roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.

In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Because of severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, agricultural activities have been brought to a near standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. Coffee production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. In sharp contrast to a bleak picture of devastation and bare subsistence is expanding oil production, now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at . Diamonds provided much of the revenue for Savimbis UNITA rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits.

Exports in 2004 reached US$10,530,764,911. The vast majority of Angolas exports, 92% in 2004, are petroleum products. US$785 million worth of diamonds, 7.5% of exports, were sold abroad that year.(99.4% of Angolas exports are oil, diamonds Afrol News) Nearly all of Angolas oil goes to the United States,  in 2006, making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the United States, and to the Republic of China,  in 2006. In the first quarter of 2008, Angola became the main exporter of oil to China.(Angola Overtakes Saudi Arabia as Biggest Oil Supplier to China Bloomberg) The rest of its petroleum exports go to Europe and America.( U.S. companies account for more than half the investment in Angola, with Chevron-Texaco leading the way. The U.S. exports industrial goods and services, primarily oilfield equipment, mining equipment, chemicals, aircraft, and food, to Angola, while principally importing petroleum. Trade between Angola and Africa exceeded USD 300 million in 2007.(Angola-South Africa trade worth over US$ 300 million per year MacauHub) From the 2000s many Chinese have settled and started up businesses.(Chinese karaoke fans sing Angolas praises)

Resources
Petroleum
Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in Africa, surpassing Nigeria in the 2000s. In January 2007 Angola became a member of OPEC. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated USD 1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the governments budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of GDP.((OECD (2006). Page 30.)

Corporation produces and receives , 27% of Angolan oil. Elf Oil, Texaco, ExxonMobil, Agip, Petrobras, and Petroleum also operate in the country.(

Block Zero provides the majority of Angolas crude oil production(OECD (2006). Page 132.) with  produced annually. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). ChevronTexaco operates in Block Zero with a 39.2% share. SONANGOL, the state oil company, Total, and ENI-Agip own the rest of the block. ChevronTexaco also operates Angolas first producing deepwater section, Block 14, with .(

The Nations has criticized the Angolan government for using torture, rape, summary executions, arbitrary detention, and disappearances, actions which Angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output.(Omeje, Kenneth C. High Stakes And Stakeholders: Oil Conflict And Security in Nigeria, 2006. Page 157.)

Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely because of its petroleum exports.(United States Congress. Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations for 1998: Hearings, 1997. Page 269.) The U.S. imports 7% of its oil from Angola, about three times as much as it imported from Kuwait just prior to the War in 1991. The U.S. Government has invested USD $4 billion in Angolas petroleum sector.(Vines, Alex. Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process, 1999. Human Rights Watch. Page 189.)

Diamonds

Angola is the third largest producer of diamonds in Africa and has only explored 40% of the diamond-rich territory within the country, but has had difficulty in attracting foreign investment because of corruption, human rights violations, and diamond smuggling.(Angola: U.S. Must Strengthen Ties to Protect Strategic Energy and Security Interests Council on Foreign Relations via AllAfrica) Production rose by 30% in 2006 and Endiama, the national diamond company of Angola, expects production to increase by 8% in 2007 to 10 million carats annually. The government is trying to attract foreign companies to the provinces of Bi, Malanje and Uge.(Angola wants foreign investors for diamond sector, July 26, 2007. Reuters)

The Angolan government loses $375 million annually from diamond smuggling. In 2003 the government began Operation Brilliant, an anti-smuggling investigation that arrested and deported 250,000 smugglers between 2003 and 2006. Rafael Marques, a journalist and human rights activist, described the diamond industry in his 2006 Angolas Deadly Diamonds report as plagued by murders, beatings, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations. Marques called on foreign countries to boycott Angolas diamonds.(Angola to double diamond production in 2006 Afrol News)

Iron

Under Portuguese rule, Angola began mining iron in 1957, producing 1.2 million tons in 1967 and 6.2 million tons by 1971. In the early 1970s, 70% of Portuguese Angolas iron exports went to Europe and Japan.( After independence in 1975, the Civil War (19752002) destroyed most of the territorys mining infrastructure. The redevelopment of the Angolan mining industry started in the late 2000s.

Alberta  is a province of Canada. It had an estimated population of 3.7 million in 2010() making it the most populous of Canadas three prairie provinces. Alberta and its neighbour, Saskatchewan, were established as provinces on September 1, 1905.()

Alberta is located in Canada, bounded by the provinces of Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the Territories to the north, and the state of Montana to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and is also one of only two provinces that are landlocked.

Edmonton, the city of Alberta, is located near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canadas oil sands and other northern resource industries. Approximately  south of the capital is Calgary, Albertas largest city and a major distribution and transportation hub. According to recent population estimates, these two metropolitan areas have now both exceeded 1 million people.() Census agglomerations in the province include Lethbridge, Red Deer, Prairie, Hat, Wood Buffalo (includes McMurray), Lloydminster, Brooks, Okotoks, Camrose, Canmore, Cold Lake, and Wetaskiwin.(  Notable tourist destinations in the province include Canmore, Sylvan Lake, Drumheller, Banff, and Jasper.

Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (18481939),() the fourth daughter of Victoria, the of Canada until 1901, and Prince Consort. Princess Louise was the wife of the Marquess of Lorne, General of Canada from 1878 to 1883. Lake Louise, the Village of Caroline, and Alberta were also named in honour of Princess Louise.

The current Premier of the province is Redford.

 Geography 



Alberta, with an area of () is the fourth largest province after Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia. To the south, the province borders on the parallel north, separating it from the U.S. state of Montana, while on the north the parallel north divides it from the Territories. To the east the meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60N until it reaches the Divide at the Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49N.

The province extends  north to south and  east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is  at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border, while its lowest point is  on the River in Buffalo National Park in the northeast.(

)

With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section, the province has adequate resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire () in Buffalo National Park, Slave Lake (), and Athabasca () which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the River which travels  from the Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.(
) The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s. The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the River, a tributary of the River.

Albertas capital city, Edmonton, is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canadas largest fields, has most of western Canadas oil refinery capacity. Calgary is located approximately  south of Edmonton and  north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the provinces population lives in the Corridor.

Most of the northern half of the province is forest, while the Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Mountain forests and Columbia foothills forests). The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to farming, with farming more common in the north and centre, while ranching and agriculture predominate in the south.(

)

The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta, where the Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. Provincial Park, near Alberta, showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.

 Climate 
Alberta has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from  in northern Alberta to  in southern Alberta. In the summer, continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from  in the mountains to  in southern Alberta.(

)

Alberta extends for over  from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average temperatures in January range from  in the south to  in the north, and in July from  in the south to  in the north.  The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a shadow over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from  in the southeast to  in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where rainfall can reach  annually.(

In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around  in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north to  in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation.
Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 and 2500 hours per year. Northern Alberta receives about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.(

In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at Creek, temperatures soared from  to  in one hour.(  The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year, while Calgary has a Christmas only 59% of the time as a result of these winds. 

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a climate. The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a semi-arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the Triangle, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent yield problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter winds. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.

After Ontario, Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience tornadoes. Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada, which is caused by lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

 Ecology 
 Flora 
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus anemone, the three flowered avens, bean, wild rose and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, fleabane, and sage. Both yellow and white clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents.

The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically aspen, poplar, and willow. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. Aspen poplar, poplar (or cottonwood), and birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include pine, Rocky Mountain pine, pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack.

 Fauna 
Image:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sheep is Albertas provincial animal
The four climatic regions (alpine, forest, parkland, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

Alberta is home to many large carnivores. Among them are the grizzly and black bears, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes, wolves, fox, lynx, bobcat and lion (cougar).

Herbivorous animals are found throughout the province. Moose, deer, and deer are found in the wooded regions, and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. sheep and goats live in the Mountains. Rabbits, porcupines, skunks, squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of snake, the prairie rattlesnake.

thumb|left|200px|Water birds in EdmontonCentral and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, geese, swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. Eagles, hawks, owls and crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other temperate regions, is home to mosquitoes, flies, wasps, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, speckled, and brown trout, and even sturgeon. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canadaas well as one of the few places in the worldthat is free of Norwegian rats.() Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can be kept in the province by only zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats were
found and captured, in small pockets in Southern Alberta,() putting Albertas rat-free status in jeopardy.

 History 
File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|C. Rutherford, Albertas first premier


The first people in Alberta were Paleo-Indians who arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the ice age. They probably migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Strait, and then may have moved down the east side of the Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas. Alternatively they may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland.() Over time they differentiated into various Nations peoples, including the Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Confederacy and the Cree, who generally lived by hunting buffalo (bison), and the more northerly tribes such as the Cree and  Chipewyan who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.()

After the British arrival in Canada, approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the River drainage, became part of Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Bay. This area was granted by II of England to the Bay Company (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of Canadians in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville. Fort La Jonquire was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.

The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Pond, who learned of the Portage, which allowed travel from southern  rivers into the rivers north of Ruperts Land.  Fur traders formed the West Company (NWC) of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his namethe Riverwhich he followed to its outlet in the Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Ocean, and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.()

The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of Louisiana, sold to the United States in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the Forty-Ninth Parallel was ceded to Great Britain.

Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities. The amalgamated Hudsons Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed Government purchased Ruperts Land. Northern Alberta was included in the Territory until 1870, when it and Ruperts land became Canadas Territories.

The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of Cameron Rutherford as the first premier.

 Demographics 


Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.()

Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas. The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.() Many of Albertas cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Over the past century, Albertas population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 2,974,807 in 2001() and 3,290,350 according to the 2006 census.()


The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the provinces population. The next most common mother tongues were various languages with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).()

Other mother tongues (in decreasing order) include: Punjabi, with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); Tagalog, with 29,740 (0.92%); Ukrainian, with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); Polish, with 21,990 (0.68%); Arabic, with 20,495 (0.64%); Dutch, with 19,980 (0.62%); and Vietnamese, with 19,350 (0.60%). The most common aboriginal language is Cree 17,215 (0.53%). Other common  mother tongues include Italian with 13,095 speakers (0.41%); Urdu with 11,275 (0.35%); and Korean with 10,845 (0.33%); then Hindi 8,985 (0.28%); Persian 7,700 (0.24%); Portuguese 7,205 (0.22%); and Hungarian 6,770 (0.21%).(Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.)(

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from England,  Scotland, Ireland and Wales, but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably Germans, French, Ukrainians and Scandinavians.(
) According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of Albertas French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.

As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Albertas population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns, and Calgary has Canadas third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2006 Canadian census, the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 English (27.2%); 679,705 German (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 Scottish (20.3%); 539,160 Irish (16.6%); 388,210 French (11.9%); 332,180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172,910 Dutch (5.3%); 170,935 Polish (5.2%); 169,355 American Indian (5.2%); 144,585 Norwegian (4.4%); and 137,600 Chinese (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)()

Amongst those of British origins, the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, Airdrie, Canmore, and Banff having Scottish origins.



Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with 13.9% of the population consisting of minorities.() Nearly one-fourth of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.()

Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up 5.8% of the population, about half of whom consist of American Indians and the other half are Metis. There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta.() The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.(

As of the 2001 Census the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 25.7% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of non-religious residents in Canada (after British Columbia) at 23.1% of the population. Of the remainder, 13.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the Church of Canada, while 5.9% were Anglican. Lutherans made up 4.8% of the population while Baptists comprised 2.5%.

The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. The Mormons of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province and made up 1.7% of the population. Alberta has a population of Hutterites, a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites (Hutterites represented 0.4% of the population while Mennonites were 0.8%), and has a significant population of Seventh-day Adventists at 0.3%. Alberta is home to several Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and the Orthodox Church of Canadas Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton.
()

Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus live in Alberta. Muslims constituted 1.7% of the population, Sikhs 0.8% and Hindus 0.5%. Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies.( Canadas oldest mosque, the Mosque is located in Edmonton,() whereas the Canadas largest mosque, the Nur mosque is located in Calgary.() Jews constituted 0.4% of Albertas population. Most of Albertas 13,000 Jews live in Calgary (7,500) and Edmonton (5,000).(AM YisraelThe Jewish Communities of Canada)

 Economy 


Albertas economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at C$74,825. This was 61% higher than the national average of C$46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.() According to the 2006 census,() the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Albertas population).() It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style of life, offering health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.

The Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada,() and the second freest economy amongst U.S. states and Canadian provinces.()

 Industry 
File:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the Oil Sands.
Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil, crude, gas and gas products in the country. Alberta is the worlds 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.() Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmontons oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.

The oil sands have estimated oil reserves approximately equal to the oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km3). With the development of new extraction methods such as assisted gravity drainage, which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional situ methods to extract the bitumen from the sands. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50 km3) of bitumen are recoverable. McMurray, one of Canadas fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.()

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the sands is the price of oil. The price increases since 2003 have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive crystal display systems.(Interactive display systemUS Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive TechnologySMART Technologies) With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

 Agriculture and forestry

Agriculture has a significant position in the provinces economy. The province has over three million head of cattle,(Alberta Livestock InspectionsAugust 2006Alberta Government, Department of Agriculture) and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.

Wheat and canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other grains are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood, and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the Rim nations with bleached pulp and newsprint.

 Tourism 


File:Stephen Avenue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Avenue, Calgary.
Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as Edmonton Mall, Stampede, outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the Games and Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like Island National Park, Buffalo National Park, and the Icefield.

According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.() Alberta tourism relies heavily on Ontario tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the States, and many international countries.

Albertas Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations Banff National Park and National Park. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Parkway. Banff is located  west of Calgary on Highway 1, and Jasper is located  west of Edmonton on Highway. Five of Canadas fourteen UNESCO heritage sites are located within the province: Rocky Mountain Parks, International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, Provincial Park and Buffalo Jump.

About 1.2 million people visit the of Stampede,() a celebration of Canadas own West and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmontons Ex (formerly Klondike Days).() Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Pass.

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, Dinosaur Capital of The World, offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canadas largest coal producers during the war years. The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service.

Located in east-central Alberta is Prairie Railway Excursions, a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler. It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery. Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to ski and hike; Alberta boasts several world-class resorts such as Village, Lake Louise, Basin, Norquay and Nakiska. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive trophies and tales from their experiences in Albertas wilderness.

 Taxation 
The provinces revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).() Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial tax (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax of 5%.) It is also the only Canadian province to have a single rate of taxation for personal income taxes which is 10% of taxable income.()

The Alberta tax system maintains a progressive character by allowing residents to earn $16,161 before becoming subject to provincial taxation in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.() Albertas municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution.  The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.() Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million.

 Transportation 


File:DavidThompsonHighway.JPG|right|thumb|220px|David Thompson Highway outside of National Park.
Alberta has over  of highways and roads, of which nearly  are paved. The main north-south corridor is Highway 2, which begins south of Cardston at the Carway border crossing and is part of the Corridor. Highway 4, which effectively extends 15 into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the Coutts border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. Highway 3 joins Lethbridge to Fort Macleod and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.

North of Edmonton, the highway continues to Athabasca, then northwesterly along the south shore of Slave Lake into High Prairie, north to Peace River, west to Fairview and finally south to Prairie, where it ends at an interchange with Highway 43. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Elizabeth II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.  Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: Highway 22, west of Highway 2, known as Cowboy Trail, and Highway 21, east of Highway 2. Highway 43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the River Country; Highway 63 travels northeast to McMurray, the location of the Athabasca Oil Sands.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the Highway system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the Highway (Highway 16), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and National Park into Columbia. One of the most scenic drives is along the Parkway, which runs for  between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

Another major corridor through central Alberta is Highway 11 (also known as the David Thompson Highway), which runs east from the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff National Park through Mountain House and Red Deer, connecting with Highway 12  west of Stettler. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.

Urban stretches of Albertas major highways and freeways are often called trails. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called Trail as it passes through Calgary but becomes Trail (for southbound traffic) and Boulevard (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of St. Albert. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent Nations individuals and tribes, such as Trail, Deerfoot Trail, and Trail.

Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial transit systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate rail transit (LRT) systems. LRT, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary C-Train has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with airports in both Calgary and Edmonton. International Airport and International Airport are the fourth and fifth busiest in Canada respectively. Calgarys airport is a hub for WestJet Airlines and a regional hub for Canada. Calgarys airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean.()  Edmontons airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.()

There are over  of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard Rail or Mountaineer. The Pacific Railway and National Railway companies operate railway freight across the province.

 Health care 

File:Alberta Childrens Hospital 3+4.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Childrens Hospital

As with all Canadian provinces, Alberta provides for all citizens and residents through a funded health care system. Alberta became Canadas second province (after Saskatchewan) to adopt a Douglas-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern medicare system.

Albertas health care budget is currently $13.2 billion during the 20082009 fiscal year (approximately 36% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada. Every hour more than $1.5 million is spent on health care in the province.()

File:University Hospital Complex University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|220px|left|of Alberta Hospital complex.
A highly educated population and burgeoning economy have made Alberta a national leader in health education, research, and resources. Many notable facilities include the Medical Centre, the Lougheed Centre, General Hospital, Childrens Hospital, Grace Womens Health Centre, The University of Calgary Medical Centre (UCMC), Baker Cancer Centre and Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, in Calgary; In Edmonton, the of Alberta Hospital,  the Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Alberta Heart Institute, the Lois Hole Hospital for Women, the Childrens Hospital, the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Cancer Institute, and the Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research in Edmonton. Currently under construction in Edmonton is the new $909 million Clinic, which will provide a similar research, education, and care environment as the Clinic in the States.()

Care in Alberta is administered by the unified Alberta Health Services Board. Prior to July 1, 2008, Alberta was divided into nine health regions: Regional Health Authority: Health Region, Health (Edmonton), Health, Thompson Regional Health Authority, Central Health, Lights Health Region, Health Region and Country Health Region.

The Trauma Air Rescue Society, a nonprofit organization, provides an ambulance service to all but the most remote areas of Alberta, and some adjoining areas of British Columbia.()

 Government 


File:Edmonton leg.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Albertas Legislative Building in Edmonton.
The government of Alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature.  Its unicameral legislaturethe Legislative Assemblyconsists of eighty-three members.

Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.  Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as counties in Alberta.

As Canadas of state, Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Ethell.  Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a figurehead whose actions are restricted by custom and constitutional convention.  The government is therefore headed by the premier. The current premier is Redford who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on October 1, 2011.  Redford was sworn in as the 14th of Alberta on October 7, 2011.

The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.

The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial governmentthe capital of Alberta.

Albertas elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (Conservatives or Tories), the Liberals, and the social democratic New Democrats. A fourth party, the strongly conservative Social Credit Party, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the Farmers of Alberta, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.

Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are several groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province.

In the 2008 provincial election, held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the Liberal Party was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two New Democratic Party members were elected.()

 Education 

File:SAIT Heart Building 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Heritage Hall at Polytechnic.
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).

 Elementary schools 
There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one (St. Albert) has a Protestant electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

Public and separate school boards, schools, and schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

 Universities 

File:Saint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|230px|right|St. Josephs College at the of Alberta.

The of Alberta, established in Edmonton in 1908, is Albertas oldest and largest university. The of Calgary, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also University, which focuses on distance learning, and the of Lethbridge, both of which are located in their title cities.

In early September 2009, Royal University became Calgarys second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made MacEwan University Edmontons second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, Alberta Institute of Technology and Alberta Institute of Technology.()

There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly Christian Universities, bringing the total number of universities to twelve, plus a University in Calgary, the only location in Canada. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.() So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta.

 Culture 


File:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Stampede.
Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The Fringe Festival is the worlds  second largest after Edinburghs. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals. With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the Festival City. The citys heritage days festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmontons Churchill Square is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton &amp; Works Art &amp; Design Festival throughout the summer months.


The City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede, dubbed The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth. The Stampede is Canadas biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as roping and riding. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.

The Centre hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international Mountain Film Festival. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the provinces cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmontons Arts Barns and the Winspear Centre for Music. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to Football League and Hockey League teams. Soccer, union and lacrosse are also played professionally in Alberta.

Paleontology
File:Pachyrhinosaurus skull.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pachyrhinosaurus skull. Large quantities of this genus are preserved in the Formation.
Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world.( Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even mass graves.( At least 38 dinosaur specimens are known from the province.( The Formation, Formation and Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta.( The stratigraphy of the River Group has a confusing history due partly to the use of the Montana-Alberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata.( The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not finalized until 1993 when Eberth and Hamblin divided the Oldman Formation in two to create the new Dinosaur Park Formation.( The resulting paleontological confusion was resolved by Currie who relocated old quarries dinosaurs had been found in and determined their distribution within the modern stratigraphic framework.(

Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely through-out Alberta.( The Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation.( In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Formation outcrops.( In the Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies. Other formations have been recorded as well, like the Milk River and Foremost Formations.( However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops.( Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites.( Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the River Group and Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Formation.( The Wapiti Formations contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however.( The Formation represents strata deposited during a transgression.( Dinosaurs are known from this Formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments.(Ryan, M. J., and Russell, A. P., 2001. Dinosaurs of Alberta (exclusive of  Aves): In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter,  K., Indiana University Press, pp. 279-297.)

Afghanistan  (Persian/Pashto: , Afnistn), officially the Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country in South and Asia.(( With a population of about 28 million, it has an area of 647,500 km, making it the 42nd most populous and 41st largest nation in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the southeast, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and the Republic of China in the far northeast. The territory that now forms Afghanistan has been an ancient focal point of the Road and migration. Archaeologists have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as 50,000 BC.() Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as 3,000 to 2,000 BC.()

The country sits at an important geostrategic location that connects the East with Central Asia and the subcontinent,() which has been home to various peoples through the ages.() The land has witnessed many military conquests since antiquity, notably by the Great, Maurya, and Khan.(( It has also served as a source from which local dynasties such as the Greco-Bactrians, Kushans, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Timurids, Mughals and many others have established empires of their own.()

The history of modern Afghanistan begins in 1709 with the rise of the Pashtuns, when the dynasty was established in Kandahar followed by Shah Durranis rise to power in 1747.()()() The capital of Afghanistan was shifted in 1776 from Kandahar to Kabul and part of the Afghan Empire was ceded to neighboring empires by 1893. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a state in the Great Game between the British and Russian empires.() On August 19, 1919, following the third Anglo-Afghan war and the signing of the of Rawalpindi, the nation regained control over its policy from the British.

After the 1978 Marxist revolution, the Union began a 10 year war in which hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians were killed. This was followed by the civil war (1992-1996), the rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government and the 2001-present war. In December 2001, the Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai administration.() While NATO and other countries are rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Talibans Shura and the network with alleged support and guidance from Pakistans powerful Intelligence (ISI) spy network are actively involved in a nationwide insurgency(, which includes countless assassinations and attacks. According to the Nations, the insurgents were responsible for 75% of civilian casualties in 2010 and 80% in 2011.((

Etymology

The name Afghnistn (, )(Cowan, William and Jaromira Rakuan. Source Book for Linguistics. 3rd ed. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1998.) means Land of the Afghans(), which originates from the ethnonym Afghan. The first part of the name Afghan designates the people since ancient times, the founders and the largest ethnic group of Afghanistan.() This name is mentioned in the form of Abgan in the 3rd century CE() and as Avagana or Afghana in the 6th century CE.( A people called the Afghans are mentioned several times in a 10th century geography book, al-alam, particularly where a reference is made to a village.Saul, a pleasant village on a mountain. In it live Afghans.() Al-Biruni referred to them in the 11th century as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the River, which would be the Mountains.() Battuta, a famous Moroccan scholar visiting the region in 1333, writes: We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called Afghans. They hold mountains and defiles and possess considerable strength, and are mostly highwaymen. Their principle mountain is called Kuh Sulayman.(
File:Afghan royal soldiers of the Durrani Empire.jpg|140px|left|thumb|Afghan soldiers of the Empire. The name Afghaunistan is written on this 1847 Lithograph by James Rattray.

One prominent 16th century Persian scholar explains extensively about the Afghans. For example, he writes:


It is widely accepted that the terms Pashtun and Afghan are synonyms. In the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet Khan Khattak it is mentioned:

The last part of the name, -stn is a suffix for place, prominent in many languages of the region. The name Afghanistan is described by the 16th century Mughal Emperor Babur in his memoirs as well as by the later Persian scholar Firishta and Baburs descendants, referring to the traditional ethnic Afghan (Pashtun) territories between the Kush mountains and the River.() In the early 19th century, Afghan politicians decided to adopt the name Afghanistan for the entire Afghan Empire after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties with Qajarid Persia and British India.(E. Huntington, The Anglo-Russian Agreement as to Tibet, Afghanistan, and Persia, Bulletin of the American Geographical Society, Vol. 39, No. 11 (1907).) In 1857, in his review of J.W. Kayes The Afghan War, Engels describes Afghanistan as:


The Afghan kingdom was sometimes refered to as the Kingdom of Kabul, as mentioned by the British statesman and historian Elphinstone.(Elphinstone, M., Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India, London 1815; published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown.) Afghanistan was officially recognized as a state by the international community after the signing of the 1919 of Rawalpindi.(M. Ali, Afghanistan: The War of Independence, 1919, Kabul s.n., 1960.)(Afghanistans Constitution of 1923 under King Amanullah Khan (English translation).)

Geography


A landlocked mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest, Afghanistan is described as being located within Asia()()(BBC: Afghanistan country profile; Britannica: Afghanistan; Center for South Asia Outreach; World Bank; U.S. maps; Syracuse University.) or Asia.() It is part of the Middle East world, which lies between latitudes 29 and 39 N, and longitudes 60 and 75 E. The countrys highest point is Nowshak, at 7,485 m (24,557 ft) above sea level. It has a continental climate with very harsh winters in the central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan) and the Corridor, where the average temperature in January is below , and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkistan plains along the River in the north, where temperatures average over  in July.

Despite having numerous rivers and reservoirs, large parts of the country are dry. The endorheic Sistan Basin is one of the driest regions in the world.() Afghanistan does not face water shortages because it receives plenty of snow during winter, especially in the Kush and Mountains, and the melting snow in the spring time enters the rivers, lakes, and streams. However, most of the countrys water (approx. 70%) flows into neighboring countries of Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and others or end up at dry deserts. The state needs more than $2 billion to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly managed.()

At , Afghanistan is the worlds 41st largest country (before France and after Burma). It is about the size of Texas in the United States. It borders Pakistan in the east and south, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far east. The country is sometimes subjected to earthquakes, mainly in the northeastern Hindu Kush mountain range. Some 125 villages were damaged and over 4,000 people killed by two earthquakes in 1998. 

The countrys natural resources include: coal, copper, ore, lithium, uranium, earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, marble, precious and stones, gas, and petroleum among other things.((( It was revealed recently that the country has about $13 trillion worth of lithium and other rare earth elements.()()((Afghanistans Buried Riches. Sarah Simpson. Scientific American, October 2011, pp. 42-49.)

History


Excavations of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree and others suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world.((John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska. Archived October 31, 2009.)(Nancy H. Dupree (1973): An Historical Guide To Afghanistan, Chapter 3 Sites in Perspective.) An important site of early historical activities, many say that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.() 

Afghanistan is at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the Iranian peoples who established the dominant role of languages in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the Empire, the Macedonian Empire, the Indian Maurya Empire, the Islamic Empire and the Sassanid Empire. 

Many kingdoms have also risen to power in what is now Afghanistan, such as the Greco-Bactrians, Kushans, Hephthalites, Shahis, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Kartids, Timurids, Mughals, and finally the Hotaki and Durrani dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state of Afghanistan.

Archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by the culture of and trade with neighboring regions to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and ages have been found in Afghanistan.(Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, Pre-Islamic Period, by Craig Baxter (1997).) Urban civilization may have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby Valley Civilization.( 

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia moved south into the boundaries of modern Afghanistan, among them were many Indo-European-speaking Indo-Iranians.( These tribes later migrated further south to India, west to what is now Iran, and towards Europe via the area north of the Caspian.(Bryant, Edwin F. (2001) The quest for the origins of Vedic culture: the Indo-Aryan migration debate Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, ISBN 0-19-513777-9.) The region was called Ariana.((Afghanistan: ancient Ariana (1950), Information Bureau, London, p3.)(M. Witzel, The Vdvda list obviously was composed or redacted by someone who regarded Afghanistan and the lands surrounding it as the home of all Indo-Iranians (airiia), that is of all (eastern) Iranians, with Airiianem Vajah as their center. page 48, The Home Of The Aryans, Festschrift J.

The ancient Zoroastrianism religion is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh.(Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, Achaemenid Rule, ca. 550-331 B.C.)(The history of Afghanistan, Ghandara.com website.)(Afghanistan: Achaemenid dynasty rule, Ancient Classical History, about.com.) Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenid Persian Empire overthrew the Medes and incorporated the region (known as Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria in Greek) within its boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of King I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries he had conquered.(Nancy H. Dupree, An Historical Guide to Kabul)

the Great and his Macedonian army arrived in the area of Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating III of Persia a year earlier in the of Gaugamela.( Following Alexanders brief occupation, the successor state of the Empire controlled the area until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the Indian Empire as part of an alliance treaty.64 BC  24 AD The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until about 185 BCE when they were overthrown.( Their decline began 60 years after Ashokas rule ended, leading to the Hellenistic reconquest of the region by the Greco-Bactrians. Much of it soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks had been defeated and expelled by the Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE.

During the 1st century BCE, the Empire subjugated the region, but lost it to their Indo-Parthian vassals. In the mid to late 1st century CE the vast Empire, centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the Sassanids in the 3rd century CE. Although various rulers calling themselves Kushanshas (generally known as the Indo-Sassanids) continued to rule at least parts of the region, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids.(Dani, A. H. and B. A. Litvinsky. The Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom. In: History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume III. The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750. Litvinsky, B. A., ed., 1996. Paris: UNESCO Publishing, pp. 103118. ISBN 92-3-103211-9.) 

The late Kushans were followed by the Kidarite Huns(Zeimal, E. V. The Kidarite Kingdom in Central Asia. In: History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume III. The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750. Litvinsky, B. A., ed., 1996, Paris: UNESCO Publishing, pp. 119133. ISBN 92-3-103211-9.) who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful Hephthalites, as rulers in the first half of the 5th century.(Litvinsky, B. A. The Hephthalite Empire. In: History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume III. The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750. Litvinsky, B. A., ed., 1996, Paris: UNESCO Publishing, pp. 135162. ISBN 92-3-103211-9.) The Hephthalites were defeated by I in CE 557, who re-established Sassanid power in Persia. However, in the 6th century CE, the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in Kabulistan called Shahi.

Islamization and Mongol invasion

Between the fourth and nineteenth centuries, much of modern Afghanistan was known by the regional name as Khorasan.()() Two of the four main capitals of Khorasan (i.e. Balkh, Merv, Nishapur and Herat) are now located in modern Afghanistan, while Kandahar, Zabulistan, Ghazni and Kabulistan formed the frontier between Khorasan and Hindustan.() The land inhabited by the Afghan tribes (i.e. ancestors of modern Pashtuns) was called Afghanistan, which loosely covered the area between the Kush and the River, with the Mountains being the center.()()
File:Herat Masjidi Jami courtyard.jpg|thumb|Built during the Ghurids era, the Mosque of Herat or Masjid Jami is one of the oldest mosques in Afghanistan.
Arab Muslims brought the message of Islam to the western area of what is now Afghanistan during the 7th century and began spreading eastward, some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted.() Afghanistan at that time was Zoroastrian, Buddhist and Hindu, with smaller populations of Jews, Christians and others.() The Shahi rulers lost their Kabul capital in around 870 AD after it was conquered by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence into the Hindu Kush area from Bukhara in the north. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims lived side by side.921 AD

Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the world during the Golden Age.()( By the 11th century the Ghaznavids had finally Islamized all of the remaining non-Muslim areas, with the exception of the Kafiristan region. They were replaced by the Ghurids who expanded and advanced the already powerful empire. In 1219 AD, Khan and his Mongol barbarians overran the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh.(Central Asian world cities. Faculty.washington.edu.) The destruction caused by the Mongols depopulated major cities and forced many of the locals to revert to an agrarian rural society.(Obamas war: Deploying 17,000 raises stakes in Afghanistan. USATODAY.com. February 18, 2009.) Mongol rule continued with the Ilkhanate in the northwest while the dynasty controlled the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush, until the invasion of Timur who established the dynasty in 1370.(Timurid Dynasty, Encyclopdia Britannica Online Edition.) During the Ghaznavid, Ghurid, and Timurid eras, Afghanistan produced many fine Islamic architectural monuments as well as numerous scientific and literary works.

Babur, a descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan, arrived from Central Asia and captured Kabul from the Arghun dynasty, and from there he began to seize control of the central and eastern territories of Afghanistan. He remained in Kabulistan until 1526 when he and his army invaded Delhi in India to replace the Afghan dynasty with the Empire. From the 16th century to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was part of three regional kingdoms: the of Bukhara in north, the Safavids in the west and the remaining larger area was ruled by the Sultanate.

Afghan nation-state
Hotaki dynasty and the Durrani Empire

File:Mirwais-Hotak.jpeg|thumb|upright|Hotak revolted against the Safavid rule and declared the Kandahar region an independent Afghan kingdom in 1709, which was later expanded by his son Mahmud to include Persia.
Hotak, seen as Afghanistans Washington(), successfully rebelled against the Persian Safavids in 1709. He overthrew and killed Gurgin Khan, and made the Afghan region independent from Persia. By 1713, Mirwais had decisively defeated two larger Persian armies, one was led by Khusraw Khn (nephew of Gurgin) and the other by Rustam Khn. The armies were sent by Husayn, the Shah in Isfahan (now Iran), to re-take control of the Kandahar region.() Mirwais died of a natural cause in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz followed by his son Mahmud. In 1722, Mahmud led an Afghan army to the Persian capital of Isfahan, sacked the city after the of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia.( The Persians were disloyal to the Afghan rulers, and after the massacre of thousands of religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family, the dynasty was ousted from Persia after the 1729 of Damghan.()

In 1738, Shah and his Afsharid forces captured Kandahar from Shah Hotaki, at which point the incarcerated 16 year old Shah Durrani was freed and made the commander of Nader Shahs four thousand Abdali Afghans.() From Kandahar they set out to conquer India, passing through Ghazni, Kabul, Lahore and ultimately plundering Delhi after the of Karnal. Nader Shah and his army abandoned Delhi but took with them huge treasure, which included the Koh-i-Noor and Noor diamonds.()

After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, the Afghans gathered near Kandahar at a jirga (grand assembly) to select their of state from a group of generals and Ahmad Shah Durrani was chosen. Regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan,()()() Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with Delhi in India.() He defeated the Sikhs of the Empire in the region nine times, one of the biggest battles was the 1761 Battle of Panipat. 

In October 1772, Ahmad Shah Durrani died of a natural cause and was buried at a site now adjacent to the of the Cloak in Kandahar. He was succeeded by his son, Shah Durrani, who transferred the capital of Afghanistan from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776. After Timur Shahs death in 1793, the Durrani throne was passed down to his son Zaman Shah followed by Mahmud Shah, Shuja Shah and others. 

The Afghan Empire was under threat in the early 1800s by the Sikhs in the east and the Persians in the west. The western province of Herat was invaded by the Persians but was successfully fought off by Fateh Khan, brother of Mohammad Khan. The Sikhs, under Singh, invaded Afghanistans Pakhtunkhwa region in 1809.(Nalwa, V. (2009), Hari Singh Nalwa  Champion of the Khalsaji, New Delhi: Manohar, p. 18, ISBN 81-7304-785-5.) Fateh Khan was defeated by Singh Nalwa in the 1813 of Attock.() Fateh Khan had installed 21 of his brothers in positions of power throughout the Afghan Empire. After his death, they rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan had many temporary rulers until Dost Mohammad Khans take over in 1826.( The Afghan army descended in 1837 through the Pass on Sikh forces at Jamrud. The Sikhs held off the Afghan offensive for over a week  the time it took reinforcements to reach Jamrud from Lahore.(Nalwa, V. (2009), Hari Singh Nalwa  Champion of the Khalsaji, New Delhi: Manohar, p. 198, ISBN 81-7304-785-5.) By this time the British had reached the area from the east, which initiated the Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842).

Barakzai dynasty and Western influence

Following the Anglo-Afghan War and the ascension of the dynasty, Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to British India. Ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the 1893 Line, an action which would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India (later the new state of Pakistan). The United Kingdom exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until the reign of King Khan in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained independence over its foreign affairs after the signing of the of Rawalpindi.
File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05493, Berlin, Besuch Knig von Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|King Khan at Berlin in February 1928. His 192728 European tour initiated an alliance between Afghanistan and Germany.
King Amanullah moved to end his countrys traditional isolation in the years following the Anglo-Afghan War. He established diplomatic relations with major states and, following a 192728 tour of Europe and Turkey, introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was Tarzi, an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistans first constitution (declared through a Jirga), which made elementary education compulsory.(Education in Afghanistan, published in Encyclopdia Iranica, volume VIII  pp. 237241...UIUC.edu.) 

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by Kalakani. Prince Nadir Shah, Amanullahs cousin, in turn defeated and killed Habibullah Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation. In 1933, however, he was assassinated in a revenge killing by a Kabul student. 

Zahir Shah, Nadir Shahs 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946 Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shahs uncles, Mahmud Khan, became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by Daoud Khan, the kings cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the Union and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in War II, nor aligned with either power bloc in the War. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistans main highways, airports and other vital infrastructure. By the late 1960s, many Western travelers were using these as part of the trail. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first of Afghanistan.

Marxist revolution and Soviet war

File:Day after Saur revolution in Kabul (773).jpg|thumb|Outside the Presidential Palace (Arg) in Kabul, a day after the Marxist revolution in April 1978.
In 1978, a prominent member of the Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), Akbar Khyber, was allegedly killed by the Daoud government. Leaders of the PDPA feared that Daoud was planning to dismantle them because many were being arrested. Amin along with other PDPA members managed to remain at large and organised an uprising. The PDPA, led by Mohammad Taraki, Karmal and Hafizullah Amin, overthrew the regime of Mohammad Daoud, who was assassinated along with his family and relatives. Taraki was declared President, Prime Minister and General Secretary of the PDPA. He moved to carry out an ill-conceived reform, which was misunderstood by virtually all Afghans.() The PDPA imprisoned, tortured and murdered thousands of members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment, and the intelligentsia.( They also prohibited usury() and made a number of statements on womens rights, by declaring equality of the sexes( and introducing women to political life. Ratebzad was one of several female Marxist leaders and a member of the Revolutionary Council.

As part of its War strategy, the United States strengthened political ties with Pakistan althought Brzezinski, National Security Advisor to U.S. President Carter, has warned that this might prompt a Soviet intervention.(French journal: Le Nouvel Observateur, 1521 January 1998. in an interview, Brzezinski claimed that these measures were in fact specifically designed to provoke a Soviet military intervention. http://contreinfo.info/article.php3?id_article1403%E2%80%B3) The Intelligence Agency (CIA) began using Pakistans Intelligence (ISI) as a proxy network to recruit, finance and arm the multi-national Mujahideen fighters inside Pakistan, which was aimed to prevent the Soviet Union from reaching the oil-rich Gulf through Balochistan. In March 1979, Hafizullah Amin took over as Prime Minister of Afghanistan, retaining the position of marshal and becoming Vice-President of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained the president and in control of the army until he was killed in September 1979.

To bolster the Parcham faction and as part of its Cold War strategy to ultimately reach Gwadar in Balochistan, the Soviet Union decided to invade Afghanistan in December 1979 by sending over 100,000 soldiers of the Army to its southern neighbor. In the meantime, Hafizullah Amin was killed and replaced by Babrak Karmal. In response to all these, the Reagan administration in the U.S. increased arming and funding of the Mujahideen, thanks in large part to the efforts of Charlie Wilson and CIA officer Avrakotos. Early reports estimated $620 billion() but more recent reports suggest that up to $40 billion were provided by the U.S. and Arabia to Pakistan.()() This was in the forms of cash and weapons, which included over two thousand Stinger missiles. The money and weapons were directly given to Armed Forces, which was distributed by its ISI network to various Mujahideen groups although much of it was secretly kept for Pakistans own defense and other purposes. Despite receiving only minor aid compared to leaders of other Mujahideen groups, Shah Massoud was named the Afghan who won the cold war by the Wall Street Journal.()

The 10-year Soviet war resulted in the killings of between 600,000 to as high as 2 million Afghans, mostly civilians.() About 6million fled to Pakistan and Iran, and from there tens of thousands began immigrating to the Union, United States, Australia and other parts of the world.(Refugee Admissions Program for Near East and South Asia. Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.) Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989 but continued to support Afghan President Najibullah until 1992.(Afghanistan: History, Columbia Encyclopedia.)

Foreign interference and civil war
199296


After the fall of the communist Najibullah-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the State of Afghanistan and appointed an government for a transitional period, under President Rabbani. According to Rights Watch:

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan.() Afghanistan expert Saikal concludes in Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival:

In addition, Arabia and Iran  as competitors for regional hegemony  supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other.() According to Human Rights Watch, Iran was assisting the Shia Hazara Wahdat forces of Ali Mazari, as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdats military power and influence.()((GUTMAN, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington D.C.) Saudi Arabia supported the Wahhabite Rasul Sayyaf and his Islami faction.(( Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war. A publication by the Washington University describes:
Outside forces saw instability in Afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas.()

Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly-created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while Kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project.(() Because of the chaos, some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their (sub-)commanders.() For civilians there was little security from murder, rape and extortion.( An estimated 25,000 people died during the most intense period of bombardment by Hekmatyars Hezb-i Islami and the Milli forces of Rashid Dostum, who had created an alliance with Hekmatyar in 1994.( Half a million people fled Afghanistan.( Human Rights Watch writes:


Southern Afghanistan was under the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as Agha Sherzai and their militias. In 1994, the Taliban (a movement originating from Ulema-e-Islam-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.(Matinuddin, Kamal, The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 19941997, University Press, (1999), pp. 2526) Mullah Omar started his movement with fewer than 50 armed madrassah students in his hometown of Kandahar.( When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.( In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

In late 1994, most of the militia factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic States of Defense Shah Massoud. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt.((Amnesty International. Document  Afghanistan: further information on fear for safety and new concern: Deliberate and arbitrary killings: Civilians in Kabul. 16 November 1995 Accessed at: Amnesty.org)() The Islamic State government took steps to restore law and order.(BBC Newsnight 1995) Courts started to work again.( Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process.() The Taliban declined.(

They were both anti-Taliban leaders, Massoud was assassinated on 9 September 2001 by two al-Qaeda associates and is now recognized as a National Hero in Afghanistan, and Qadir was assassinated in July 2002.
The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under Shah Massoud.( see video International, referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report:

The Talibans early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses.( Pakistan provided strong support to the Taliban.(() Many analysts like Saikal describe the Taliban as developing into a proxy force for Pakistans regional interests which the Taliban decline.(
On September 26, 1996, as the Taliban with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul.(Coll, Ghost Wars (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.) The Taliban seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Emirate of Afghanistan. They imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their political and judicial interpretation of Islam issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.() The Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) analyze:

After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on September 27, 1996,( ) Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum, two former archnemesis, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. see video The United Front included beside the dominantly Tajik forces of Massoud and the Uzbek forces of Dostum, Hazara factions and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq, Haji Abdul Qadir, Qari Baba or diplomat Rahim Ghafoorzai.

According to Human Rights Watch, in late May 1997, some 3,000 captive Taliban soldiers were summarily executed in and around Mazar-i-Sharif by Dostums Junbish forces and members of the Shia Hazara Wahdat faction.(() The Taliban defeated Dostums Junbish forces militarily by seizing Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998. Dostum went into exile.

According to a 55-page report by the UN, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians.()() U.N. officials stated that there had been 15 massacres between 1996 and 2001.(( They also said, that these have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the Taliban Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.(( The Taliban especially targeted people of Shia religious or Hazara ethnic background.(( Upon taking Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, about 4,000 civilians were executed by the Taliban and many more reported tortured.()() The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings.(( Bin Ladens so-called Brigade was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.() The report by the UN quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people.((

Pakistani President Musharraf  then as Chief of Army Staff  was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and Bin Laden against the forces of Massoud.(((() In total there were believed to be 28,000 Pakistani nationals, many either from the Corps or army, fighting inside Afghanistan.( An estimated 8,000 Pakistani militants were recruited in madrassas filling the ranks of the estimated 25,000 regular Taliban force.( A 1998 document by the State Department confirms that 2040 percent of regular Taliban soldiers are Pakistani.( The document further states that the parents of those Pakistani nationals know nothing regarding their childs military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan.(

From 1996 to 2001 the Qaeda of Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri became a state within the Taliban state.() Bin Laden sent Arab recruits to join the fight against the United Front.(()
3,000 fighters of the regular Taliban army were Arab and Central Asian militants.(  In total, of roughly 45,000 Pakistani, Taliban and Al-Qaeda soldiers fighting against the forces of Massoud only 14,000 were Afghan.((

Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the Rights Declaration.() Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001.( As a consequence many civilians fled to the area of Shah Massoud.()() In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban.() Geographic concluded in its documentary Inside the Taliban:
:
In early 2001 Massoud addressed the Parliament in Brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of Afghanistan.( He stated that the Taliban and Qaeda had introduced a very wrong perception of Islam and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.( On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.(Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report gwu.edu)

Recent history (2001present)

On 9 September 2001, Shah Massoud was assassinated by two Arab attackers inside Afghanistan and two days later about 3,000 people became victims of the 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Then US President W. Bush accused bin Laden and Sheikh Mohammed as the faces behind the attacks. When the Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden to US authorities and to disband al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, the US and British air forces began bombing al-Qaeda and Taliban targets inside Afghanistan during Enduring Freedom.() American and British special forces along with the CIA Activities Division units worked with commanders of the United Front (Northern Alliance) to launch a military offensive against the Taliban.(First In: An insiders account of how the CIA spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan by Gary Schroen, 2005) This led to the of Mazar-i-Sharif and Kabul in November 2001, as the Taliban and al-Qaida crossed over the porous Line border into Pakistan. In December 2001, after the Taliban government was toppled and the new Afghan government under Karzai was formed, the Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security to the Afghan people.(  (UNSCR 1386))()

While the Taliban began regrouping inside Pakistan, more coalition troops entered the escalating US-led war. Meanwhile, the rebuilding of war-torn Afghanistan kicked off in 2002.()() The Afghan nation was able to build democratic structures over the years, and some progress was made in key areas such as governance, economy, health, education, transport, and agriculture. NATO is training the Afghan armed forces as well its national police. ISAF and Afghan troops led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them. By 2009, a Taliban-led shadow government began to form in many parts of the country complete with their own version of mediation court.() As a result of this and other reasons, U.S. President Obama deployed another 30,000 soldiers in 2010 for a period of two years.

At the 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan in London, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he intends to reach out to the Taliban leadership (including Mullah Omar, Haqqani and Hekmatyar). Supported by NATO, Karzai called on the groups leadership to take part in a jirga meeting to initiate peace talks. These steps have resulted in an intensification of bombings, assassinations and ambushes.() Some Afghan groups (including the former intelligence chief Saleh and opposition leader Dr. Abdullah) believe that Karzai plans to appease the insurgents senior leadership at the cost of the democratic constitution, the democratic process and progess in the field of human rights especially womens rights.() Dr. Abdullah stated:
:I should say that Taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated. They are fighting in order to bring the state down. So its a futile exercise, and its just misleading. ... There are groups that will fight to the death. Whether we like to talk to them or we dont like to talk to them, they will continue to fight. So, for them, I dont think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily. In terms of the Taliban on the ground, there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country, we can attract them to the peace process; provided, we create a favorable environment on this side of the line. At the moment, the people are leaving support for the government because of corruption. So that expectation is also not realistic at this stage.()

In FY 2009, the United States resettled just 328 refugees from Afghanistan.(Fiscal Year 2009 Refugee Arrivals. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) By contrast, the U.S. admitted more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees for resettlement during the Vietnam War.(Global Views: Iraqs refugees, by R. Nolan, Foreign Policy Association Features, Resource Library, June 12, 2007.) On the other hand, over five million refugees were repatriated in the last decade, including many who were forcefully deported from NATO countries.()() This large return of Afghans may have helped the nations economy but the country still remains one of the poorest in the world due to the decades of war, lack of foreign investment, ongoing government corruption and the Pakistani-backed insurgency.()() The United States also accuses neighboring Iran of providing small level of support to the Taliban insurgents.()()() According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban and other militants were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in 2009,() 75% in 2010() and 80% in 2011.()

After the May 2011 of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, many prominent Afghan figures began being assassinated, including Daud Daud, Wali Karzai, Mohammad Khan, Haider Hamidi, Rabbani and others. Also in the same year, many large scale attacks by the Pakistani based network took place around the country. As a result, the United States warned Pakistan of a possible military action against the Haqqanis in the Administered Tribal Areas.() The U.S. blamed Pakistans government, mainly Army and its ISI spy agency, for many of the well cordinated attacks inside Afghanistan.( of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Munter, told Radio Pakistan that The attack that took place in Kabul a few days ago, that was the work of the Haqqani network. There is evidence linking the Haqqani Network to the Pakistan government. This is something that must stop.() Other top U.S. officials such as Hillary Clinton and Panetta made similar statements.()()

Government and politics

File:Parliament delays summer recess.jpg|thumb|Assembly of Afghanistan
The government of Afghanistan is an republic consisting of three branches, executive, legislative and judicial. The nation is currently led by the Karzai administration with Karzai as the President and leader since late 2001. The National Assembly is the legislature, a bicameral body having two chambers, the House of the People and the of Elders. The Supreme Court is led by Chief Justice Salam Azimi, a former university professor who had been a legal advisor to the president.(E-Ariana.com, New Supreme Court Could Mark Genuine Departure  August 13, 2006.) The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more technocrats than the previous one, which was dominated by fundamentalist religious figures such as Chief Justice Ahmad Shinwari who issued several controversial rulings, including seeking to place a limit on the rights of women.

According to Internationals corruption perceptions index 2010 results, Afghanistan was ranked as the third most-corrupt country in the world.() A number of government ministries are believed to be rife with corruption, while President Karzai vowed to tackle the problem in late 2009 by stating that individuals who are involved in corruption will have no place in the government.() A January 2010 report published by the Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed that bribery consumes an amount equal to 23 percent of the GDP of the nation.() It should be noted that all institutions in the country are newly formed and starting from scratch, and that steps are taken to arrest those involved in corruption.()

Elections and parties

The 2004 Afghan presidential election was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the 2009 presidential election was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and widespread electoral fraud.()(Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped) The vote, along with elections for 420 provincial council seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.()

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger Abdullah was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he is not participating in the November 7 run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another 5-year term.(

In the 2005 parliamentary election, among the elected officials were former mujahideen, fundamentalists, warlords, communists, reformists, and several Taliban associates.() In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th nation in terms of female representation in parliament.() The last parliamentary election was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the sworn in ceremony took place in late January 2011. After the issuance of computerized ID cards for the first time, which is a $101 million project that the Afghan government plans to start in 2012, it is expected to help prevent major fraud in future elections and improve the security situation.(Kabul residents to get computerised ID cards in 5 months. Pajhwok Afghan News. September 18, 2011.)

Political divisions

Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (wilayats), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The provincial governors are appointed by the of Afghanistan and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils which are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.(Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan) The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. As for the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 of Afghanistan in alphabetical order and on the right is a map showing where each province is located:

Foreign relations and military

File:US Embassy in Kabul on July 4th 2010.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Official diplomatic relations between the United States and Afghanistan began in the early 1920s. The States Department of State has established a consulate in Herat in the west, with plans to open more in Mazar-e-Sharif in the north, Kandahar in the south, and Jalalabad in the east.
The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for managing the relations of Afghanistan. The nation has been a member of the UN since 1946, and has maintained good relations with the United States and other NATO member states since the signing of the of Rawalpindi in 1919. The Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under Nations Security Council Resolution 1401 to help the nation recover from decades of war and establish a normal functioning government. Today, more than 22 NATO nations deploy about 140,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Apart from close military links, Afghanistan also enjoys strong economic relations with NATO members and their allies.

Afghanistan also has diplomatic relations with neighboring Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the Republic of China, including regional states such as India, Turky, Kazakhstan, Russia, Arab Emirate, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Japan, South Korea, and others. Afghanistans relationship with Pakistan has often fluctuated since 1947.(Hasnat, Syed Farooq, Pakistan &amp; Afghanistan: Domestic Pressures and Regional Threats in Journal of International Affairs, Vol. 63, Fall/Winter 2009, pp. 14155, Columbia University link Since 1947, serious differences and tensions have existed between the two respective governments at various phases of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations.)(Resolving the PakistanAfghanistan Stalemate, United States Institute of Peace, Afghanistan and Pakistan have had largely antagonistic relations under all governments) They have security and economic links with each other but disputes between the two states remain. Afghanistan continues to contest the porous and poorly-marked Line as its international border with Pakistan,() and has repeatedly accused Pakistan of supporting the Taliban insurgents, network, and other anti-Afghanistan terrorist groups.()() Pakistan harbors concerns over the growing influence of its rival India in Afghanistan.() Relations between the two states were strained further after recent border skirmishes and when Afghan officials alleged that Pakistani intelligence agencies are involved in terrorist attacks inside Afghanistan.() Despite these problems, Pakistan is a participant in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, pledging $250 million in various projects across the country,() and often announces that a stable Afghanistan is in their interest.(Stable Afghanistan in the interest of region: Zardari. Wasim Yousufzai. August 2, 2011.)

India and Iran have actively participated in reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan,() with India being the largest regional donor to the country.() Since 2002, India has pledged up to $2 billion in economic assistance to Afghanistan and has participated in multiple socio-economic reconstruction efforts, including power, roads, agricultural and educational projects.(() There are also military ties between Afghanistan and India, which is expected to increase after the October 2011 strategic pact that was signed by President Karzai and Prime Minister Singh.(Afghanistan signs 1st strategic pact _ with India)(Pakistan a twin brother, talks to go on: Karzai. Afghan News. Sujoy Dhar. October 5, 2011.)

The of Afghanistan is under the Ministry of Defense, which includes the National Army and the National Army Air Force. It currently has about 160,000 active soldiers and is expected to reach 260,000 in the coming years.( They are trained and equipped by NATO countries, mainly by the States Department of Defense. The ANA is divided into 7 major Corps, with the 201st Selab (Flood) in Kabul being the main one. The ANA also has a commando brigade which was established in 2007. The Military Academy of Afghanistan serves as the main educational institute for the militarymen of the country. A new $200 million Defense University (ADU) is under construction near the capital.

Economy

pomegranate processing.jpg|thumb|Workers processing pomegranates (anaar), which Afghanistan is famous for in Asia.
Afghanistan is an impoverished and developed country, one of the worlds poorest. The nations nominal GDP stands at $16.63 billion and the GDP per capita is about $900.() Its unemployment rate is 35% and roughly the same percentage of its citizens live below the poverty line.()() About 42 percent of the population live on less than $1 a day, according to a 2009 report.() Despite this, the economy has been growing strong in the last decade, which is due to the infusion of multi-billion dollars in international assistance and investments as well as remittances from expats. According to the Bank, economic growth has been strong and has generated better livelihoods since late 2001.() It is also due to improvements in agricultural production, which is the backbone of the nations economy.() The country is known for producing some of the finest pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits, including nuts.(Exporting Afghanistan, by P.J. Tobia. Nov 17, 2009.) 
File:Doost Marble Factory in Herat.jpg|thumb|left|The Doost Marble Factory in Herat. Current marble exports are estimated at $15 million per year. With improved extraction, processing, infrastructure, and investment, the industry has the potential to grow into a $450 million per year business.(Embassy, Kabul, Third Afghanistan Marble Conference, May 25, 2011.)

While the countrys current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The Afghan Ministry of Finance is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. For example, government revenues increased 31% to $1.7 billion from March 2010 to March 2011. Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation and the Afghani (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of 50 Afghanis to 1 US dollar. Since 2003, over 16 new banks have opened in the country, including International Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Chartered Bank, Micro Finance Bank, and others. 

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million Afghan expatriates, who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. For the first time since the 1970s, Afghans have involved themselves in construction, one of the largest industries in the country, although some have been cheated by American contractors.() A number of companies and small factories began operating in different parts of the country, which not only provide revenues to the government but also create many jobs. Improvements to the business-enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.() The rugs are becoming popular again and this gives many carpet dealers around the country to expand their business by hiring more workers.

Afghanistan is a member of SAARC, ECO and OIC. It is aiming to develop closer economic ties with neighboring countries in the so-called New Silk Road major project of the future. Foreign Minister Rassoul told the media in 2011 that his nations goal is to achieve an Afghan economy whose growth is based on trade, private enterprise and investment.() production in Afghanistan has soared to a record in 2007 with about 3 million people reported to be involved in the business(UN horrified by surge in opium trade in Helmand.) but then declined significantly in the years following.(Afghan opium production in significant decline, UNDOC) The government started programs to help reduce cultivation of poppy, and by 2010 it was reported that 24 out of the 34 provinces were free from poppy grow.

Mining and energy

Afghanistans economy has a brite future due to its natural resources. According to recent U.S. Geological surveys that were funded by the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to  of natural gas,  of petroleum and up to  of gas liquids.(Afghanistans Energy Future and its Potential Implications, Eurasianet.org.) Other recent reports show that the country has huge amounts of gold, copper, coal, iron ore and other minerals.()()()() In 2010, Pentagon officials along with geologists from the United States announced the discovery of $13 trillion worth untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan.( Afghan officials assert that this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy and a memo from the Pentagon stated that Afghanistan could become the Saudi Arabia of lithium.()()()() Another US geological survey estimate from 2011 shows that the Khanashin carbonatites in the Province of the country have an estimated 1 million metric tonnes of earth elements.(Huge rare-earth material in Helmand: USGS. By Lalit K Jha for Afghan News. September 15, 2011.) Extraction of its copper and iron reserves is expected to start in 2013, which would earn billions of dollars in royalties and taxes every year for the next 100 years. Analysts believe that if the Afghan state was to generate even $10 billion per year from its mineral deposits, its national product would double and provide long-term funding for Afghan security forces and other critical needs.(OHanlon, Michael E. Deposits Could Aid Ailing Afghanistan, The Brookings Institution, 16 June 2010.)

Transport and communications

File:Ariana Afghan A310-300 F-GEMO.jpg|thumb|upright|Afghan Airlines
Afghanistan has about 53 airports, with the biggest ones being the International Airport, Air Base followed by International Airport in the south and Airport in the west. Afghan Airlines is the national carrier, with domestic flights between Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif. International flights include to Dubai, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Delhi, Islamabad and a number of other Asian destinations.() There are limited domestic and international flight services available from the locally owned Air, Airways and Airways. Airlines from a number of regional nations such as Airlines, Air, Arabia, India, International Airlines and others also provide services to Afghanistan.

The country has limited rail service with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in the north. As of 2011, two other railway projects are in progress with neighboring nations, one is between Herat and Iran while another is to connect with Railways. Long distant journies are made by private coaches or private cars. Newer automobiles have recently become more widely available after the rebuilding of roads and highways. They are imported from the Arab Emirates through Pakistan and Iran. Afghanistans postal and package services such as FedEx, DHL and others make deliveries to major cities and towns.

Telecommunication services in the country are provided by Wireless, Etisalat, Roshan, Group and Telecom. In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a $64.5 million agreement with ZTE for the establishment of a countrywide fiber cable network. As of 2009, the country has 129,300 fixed telephone lines,(CIA.gov) about 12 million mobile phone subscribers(CIA.Gov) and 1 million internet users.(CIA.gov)

Demographics

As of July 2010, the population of Afghanistan is around 28,395,716() but it is unconfirmed if the 3 million refugees still living in Pakistan and Iran are included or not. A 2009 UN estimate shows that the Afghan population was 28,150,000() but a 20092010 nationwide survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Afghanistan has put it at 26 million, not counting some parts of the country due to insecurity.( ) The only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul. The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kunduz, Jalalabad, Gah, Taloqan, Khumri, Khost, Ghazni, Sheberghan, Sar-e Pol, and Farah. Urban areas are experiencing rapid population growth following the return of over 5 million expats from Pakistan and Iran. According to the Reference Bureau, the Afghan population is estimated to increase to 82 million by 2050.()

Ethnic groups

Army ethnolinguistic map of Afghanistan -- circa 2001-09.jpg|thumb|Ethnolinguistic groups of Afghanistan
Afghanistan is a society. The population of the country is divided into a wide variety of ethnolinguistic groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the nation in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are unvailable.(Afghan polls ethnic battleground  October 6, 2004. BBC)
An approximate distribution of the nations total ethnic groups is shown in the chart below:

File:Village girls of Guzara district in Herat province-2009.jpg|thumb|Afghan girls from the District of Province
File:Boys in Ghazni.jpg|thumb|Boys from Province
The percentage numbers in the chart at the bottom are from recent national opinion polls aimed at knowing how Afghan citizens feel about the 2001present US-led war, the current political situation, as well as the economic and social issues affecting their daily lives. One was conducted in 2010 by the Asia Foundation (with technical assistance by the Afghan Center for Socio-economic and Opinion Research) and the other between 2004 to 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies ABC News, the BBC, and ARD.()()

The 2010 Asia Foundation survey involved 6,467 randomly selected Afghan citizens from across all of Afghanistans 34 provinces. The margin of sampling error in that survey is 4.4 percent, at a 95 percent confidence interval.()

To questions about their ethnicity at the end of the questionnaires, the results of the total 8,001 Afghan citizens (6,467 respondents from The Asia Foundation survey; 1,534 respondents from the ABC, BBC, and ARD survey) came as:



Languages

The two languages of Afghanistan are Pashto (since 1936) and (Persian) (since 1964), making bilingualism very common. Both are languages from the languages sub-family.() Persian has always been the prestige language and as the main means of inter-ethnic communication, maintaining its status of franca. Persian is the native tongue of various Afghan ethnic groups including the Tajiks, Hazaras, Aimaks and Kizilbash.() Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, although many non-Pashtuns are also fluent speakers of this language. Other languages, such as Uzbek, Arabic, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashayi and languages (Ashkunu, Kamkata-viri, Vasi-vari, Tregami and Kalasha-ala), are used as native tongue by minority groups across the country and have official status in the regions where they are widely spoken. Minor languages also include Pamiri (Shughni, Munji, Ishkashimi and Wakhi), Brahui, Hindko, Kyrgyz, etc. Many Afghans are also fluent in Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, English, and other languages.(

Religions

Over 99% of the Afghan population is Muslim: approximately 8085% follow the Sunni sect, 1519% are Shia, and 1% other.()()()() Until the 1890s, the region around Nuristan was known as Kafiristan (land of the kafirs) because of its inhabitants: the Nuristanis, an ethnically distinctive people who practiced animism, polytheism and shamanism.() Other than Muslims, there are tiny communities of Hindus and Sikhs found in the four major cities of the country. They number in the thousands.(Hinduism Today: Hindus Abandon Afghanistan.)(BBC South Asia: Sikhs struggle in Afghanistan.) There was also a small Jewish community in Afghanistan who emigrated to Israel and the United States by the end of the last century, and only one individual by the name of Simintov remains today.(Washingtonpost.com  Afghan Jew Becomes Countrys One and Only  N.C. Aizenman.)

Culture

Afghan Youth Voices Festival.jpg|thumb|300px|The 2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival inside the Gardens of Babur in Kabul, which is the capital and a multi-ethnic city.
The Afghan culture has been around for over two millennia, tracing record to at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BCE.()(Barbara Robson, Juliene Lipson, Farid Younos, Mariam Mehdi. ) It is mostly a nomadic and society, with different regions of the country having their own tradition, reflecting the multi-cultural and multi-lingual character of the nation. In the southern and eastern region, as well as western Pakistan which was historically part of Afghanistan, the people live according to the culture by following Pashtunwali, which is an ancient way of life that is still preserved.(US Library of Congress: Afghanistan  Ethnic Groups (Pashtun)) The remaining of the country is culturally Persian and Turkic. Some non-Pashtuns who live in close proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali() in a process called Pashtunization (or Afghanization) while some Pashtuns have been Persianized. Millions of Afghans who have been living in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations.

Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes.(Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) The Afghan Wars 18391919, Sellmount Staplehurst.) As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.( There are an estimated 60 major tribes,(Pashtun (people). Encyclopdia Britannica.) and the Afghan nomads are estimated at about 23 million.(Afghanistan: Kuchi nomads seek a better deal. IRIN Asia. February 18, 2008.)

The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars.(G.V. Brandolini. Afghanistan heritage. Orizzonte terra, Bergamo. 2007. p. 64.) The two famous of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as idolatrous. Despite that archaeologists are still finding Buddhist relics in different parts of the country, some of them date back to the 2nd century.()()() This indicates that Buddhism was widespread in Afghanistan. Other historical places include the cities of Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Zarang. The of Jam in the Hari River valley is a UNESCO World Heritage site. A cloak reputedly worn by Islams Prophet Muhammad is kept inside the of the Cloak in Kandahar, a city founded by Alexander and the first capital of Afghanistan. The citadel of Alexander in the western city of Herat has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction for tourists. In the north of the country is the of Hazrat Ali, believed by many to be the location where Ali was buried. The Afghan Ministry of Information and Culture is renovating 42 historic sites in Ghazni until 2013, when the province will be declared as the capital of Islamic civilization.() The Museum of Afghanistan is located in Kabul.

Although literacy level is low, classic Persian and Pashto poetry play an important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include Rumi, Balkhi, Sanai, Jami, Khan Khattak, Baba, Khalili, and Pazhwak.(Classical Dari and Pashto Poets)

Media

File:Farhad Daryas Peace Concert in 2010-cropped.jpg|thumb|Darya performing at the Hotel in Kabul.
The Afghan mass media began in the early 20th century, with the first newspaper published in 1906. By the 1920s, Kabul was broadcasting local radio services. National Television was launched in 1974 but was closed in 1996 when the media was tightly controlled by the Taliban.(Dartnell, M. Y. Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict. University of Toronto Press, 2006. ISBN 978-0-8020-8553-5.) Since 2002, press restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified. of expression and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and censorship is banned, though defaming individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of Islam is prohibited. In 2008, Without Borders listed the media environment as 156 out of 173, with the 1st being most free. 400 publications were registered, at least 15 local Afghan television channels and 60 radio stations.(Afghanistan Press Report 2008, Freedom House.) Foreign radio stations, such as of America, World Service, and Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcast into the country.

The city of Kabul has been home to many musicians in the past, who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the Nowruz (New Year) and National Independence Day celebrations. Most Afghans are accustomed to watching Bollywood films from India and listening to its filmi hit songs. Many of the Bollywood film stars have roots in Afghanistan, including Madhubala, Khan, Khan, Khan, Khan, and others. Several Bollywood films such as Dharmatma, Gawah, from Taliban and Express have been shot inside Afghanistan.

Sports

The national football team has been competing in international football since 1941 and currently has a world ranking of 179. The national team plays its home games at the Stadium in Kabul, while in Afghanistan is governed by the Football Federation. The national team has never competed or qualified for the World Cup. The country also has a national team in the sport of futsal, a game very similar to football. Some of the other popular sports in Afghanistan include cricket, basketball, volleyball, taekwondo, boxing, and bodybuilding.()

Cricket, which is a newly introduced in Afghanistan fuelled by the success of the Afghan national cricket team is growing in popularity.() It has risen from the lower levels of international cricket to qualifying for the 2010 Twenty20 World Cup. More recently the under-19 team has qualified for the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.() The Cricket Board (ACB) is the official governing body of the sport and is headquartered in Kabul. The Amanullah Khan International Cricket Stadium serves as the nations main cricket stadium, followed by the National Cricket Stadium. Several other stadiums are under construction.() Cricket is played between teams from different provinces, mostly by the Pashtuns on both sides of the Line.

Buzkashi is a traditional sport, mainly among the northern Afghans. It is similar to polo, played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a goat carcass. hounds (a type of running dog) originated in Afghanistan and was originally used in the sport of hunting.

Health and education

File:Regional Medical Hospital in Paktia.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside a regional military hospital in the Province
Before the Revolution in 1978, the nation had an improving care system. Ibn Sina Hospital and Ali Abad Hospital in Kabul were two of the leading health care institutions at the time. Health care was limited to urban areas only and was eventually destroyed during the civil war of the 1990s.() It is once again improving, which is due to the vaccination of children, training of medical staff and establishment of new hospitals. Many hospitals and clinics have been built over the last decade, with the most advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The Medical Institute for Children and Gandhi Childrens Hospital in Kabul are the leading hospitals in the country. Some of the other main hospitals in Kabul include the 350-bed Hospital and the Jinnah Hospital, which is still under construction. There are also a number of well-equipped military controlled hospitals in different regions of the country.

According to the Development Index, Afghanistan is the 15th least developed country in the world. The average life expectancy is 43.8 years. It is the most dangerous place for a child to be born, with the highest mortality rates in the world.() About 1 in 5 children dies before the age of five, and 1 out of every 8 women dies from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.(() While these statistics are tragic, progress is being made. It was reported in 2006 that nearly 60% of the population lives within two hours walking distance of the nearest health facility, up from nine percent in 2002. Infant mortality has decreased by 22% and child mortality has dropped by 26% since 2003.() The Afghan Ministry of Public Health plans to further cut the infant mortality rate from the current 1,600 to 400 for every 100,000 live births by the year 2020.( and Health Surveys is working with the Institute of Health Management Research to conduct a survey in Afghanistan focusing on death, among other things.() The nation also has one of the highest incidences of people with disabilities, with an estimated one million handicapped people.(Empowering Afghanistans Disabled Population. Usaid.gov. March 31, 2006.) About 80,000 citizens have lost limbs, mainly as a result of landmines.(Afghanistans refugee crisis ignored. The Guardian.

Education in the country includes K-12 and Education, which is supervised by the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Higher Education.() The nations education system was destroyed due to the decades of war, but it began reviving after the Karzai administration came to power in late 2001. About 4,000 schools were built since 2002, with more than 100,000 teachers being trained and recruited.() It was reported in 2011 that more than seven million male and female students were enrolled in schools.(

As of 2011, about 62,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country.( University reopened in 2002 to both male and female students. In 2006, the University of Afghanistan was established in Kabul, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The capital of Kabul serves as the learning center of Afghanistan, with many of the best institutions being based there. Major universities outside of Kabul include University in the south, University in the northwest, University in the north, University and University in the eastern zones, as well as a number of others. The Military Academy of Afghanistan, modeled after the States Military Academy at West Point, is a four-year military development institution dedicated to graduating officers for the Afghan armed forces. The $200 million Defense University is under construction near Qargha in Kabul. The United States is building six faculties of education and five provincial teacher training colleges around the country, two large secondary schools in Kabul and one school in Jalalabad.(

Literacy rate of the entire population is very low, possibly at 34% but is improving rapidly. Female literacy may be as low as only 10%. In 2010, the United States began establishing a number of Lincoln learning centers in Afghanistan. They are set up to serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, Internet connectivity, educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location.(http://photos.state.gov/libraries/afghanistan/231771/PDFs/RFP-Lincoln-Learning-Centers.pdf)(
http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/ghazni-gov-lincoln-learning-center.html) What Afghanistan needs is NATO supported scholarship programs to take massive number of students abroad so that when they return after finishing studies they can move their nation forward and quickly catch up with the rest of the world.

Crime and law enforcement

File:ANP moving in vehicles in 2010.jpg|thumb|National Police
The Directorate of Security (NDS) is the nations domestic agency, which operates similar to that of the States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and has between 15,000 to 30,000 employees. The nation also has about 126,000 national police officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000. The National Police (ANP) is under the Ministry of the Interior, which is based in Kabul and headed by Khan Mohammadi. The National Civil Order Police is part of the Afghan National Police, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, Gardez, Kandahar, Herat, and Mazar-i-Sharif. Every province of the country has a provincial of Police who is appointed by the Ministry of Interior and is responsible for law enforcement in all the districts within the province.

Although they are being trained by NATO countries through the Police Program, there are still problems with the force. According to a 2009 news report, large percent of Afghan police officers are illiterate and are accused of demanding bribes.(For U.S., Vast Challenge To Expand Afghan Forces : NPR.) Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANP will rise to over 50 percent by January 2012. What began as a voluntary literacy program became mandatory for basic police training in early 2011.() Approximately 17 percent of them test positive for illegal drugs. In 2009, President Karzai created two anti-corruption units within the nations Interior Ministry.() Former Interior Minister Atmar said that security officials from the U.S. (FBI), Britain (Yard) and the European Union will train prosecutors in the unit.

The south and eastern parts of Afghanistan are the most dangerous due to their distances from Kabul and their flourishing drug trade. These areas in particular are often patrolled by Taliban insurgents, and in many cases they plan attacks by using suicide bombers and planting explosive devices (IEDs) on roads. Every year many Afghan police officers are killed in the line of duty. The Border Police are responsible for protecting the nations airports and borders, especially the Line, which is a disputed border often used by criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. Reports in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people are involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan, many of the attacks on government employees and institutions are carried out not only by the Taliban militants but also by powerful criminal gangs.(While US talks withdrawal, Afghan corruption soars, by Bradley Klapper, Associated Press. June 2011.) Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to Iran, Pakistan, Russia, India, the United Arab Emirate, and the European Union. The Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics which is supported by the international community is dealing with this problem.

Asteroids (from Greek  star and  like, in form) are a class of Small Solar System Bodies in orbit around the Sun.  They have also been called planetoids, especially the larger ones. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disk of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet, but as small objects in the outer Solar System were discovered, their volatile-based surfaces were found to more closely resemble comets, and so were often distinguished from traditional asteroids.() Thus the term asteroid has come increasingly to refer specifically to the small rockyicy and metallic bodies of the inner Solar System out to the orbit of Jupiter. They are grouped with the outer bodiescentaurs, trojans, and objectsas planets, which is the term preferred in astronomical circles.(Asimov, Isaac, and Dole, Stephen H. Planets for Man (New York:  Random House, 1964), p.43) This article will restrict the use of the term asteroid to the minor planets of the inner Solar System. 

There are millions of asteroids, many thought to be the often shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within the young Suns nebula that never grew large enough to become planets.()  A large majority of known asteroids orbit in the belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter or co-orbital with Jupiter (the Trojans). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the asteroids. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra, with the majority falling into three main groups: C-type, S-type, and M-type. These were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich, stony, and metallic compositions, respectively.



 Naming 

A newly discovered asteroid is given a provisional designation (such as ) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. Eros). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.

 Symbols 

The first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets. By 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols, which often occurred in several variants.()


Franz Encke made a major change in the 1854 edition of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook). He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid, though he assigned  to the fifth, Astraea, the first four continuing with their existing symbols. The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by the astronomical community, and no iconic symbols were created after 1855.(Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as Chiron:  ) That year Astraeas number was bumped up to , but Ceres through Vesta would not be listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle would become a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.(

 Discovery 
Image:243 ida.jpg|thumb|right|Ida and its moon Dactyl. Dactyl is the first satellite of an asteroid to be discovered.
The first asteroid to be discovered, Ceres, was found in 1801 by Piazzi, and was originally considered to be a new planet.(Ceres is the largest asteroid and is now classified as a planet. All other asteroids are now classified as Small Solar System Bodies along with comets, centaurs, and the smaller trans-Neptunian objects.) This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc, though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions. This prompted the astronomer Sir William Herschel to propose the term asteroid, from Greek , asteroeids star-like, star-shaped, from ancient Greek , astr star, planet. In the early second half of the nineteenth century, the terms asteroid and planet (not always qualified as minor) were still used interchangeably; for example, the Annual of Scientific Discovery for 1871, page 316, reads Professor J. Watson has been awarded by the Paris Academy of Sciences, the astronomical prize, Lalande foundation, for the discovery of eight new asteroids in one year. The planet Lydia (No. 110), discovered by M. Borelly at the Marseilles Observatory ... M. Borelly had previously discovered two planets bearing the numbers 91 and 99 in the system of asteroids revolving between Mars and Jupiter.

 Historical methods 
Asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries.

In the last years of the 18th century, Baron Xaver von Zach organized a group of 24 astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8 AU from the Sun by the law, partly because of the discovery, by Sir Herschel in 1781, of the planet Uranus at the distance predicted by the law. This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30 seconds of arc per hour, readily discernible by observers.

The first object, Ceres, was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in 1801 by Piazzi, director of the observatory of Palermo in Sicily. He discovered a new star-like object in Taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. His colleague, Friedrich Gauss, used these observations to find the exact distance from this unknown object to the Earth. Gauss calculations placed the object between the planets Mars and Jupiter. Piazzi named it after Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture.

Three other asteroids (Pallas, Juno, and Vesta) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in 1807. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.

However, Ludwig Hencke persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found Astraea, the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found Hebe less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were J. R. Hind, de Gasparis, Robert Luther, H. M. S. Goldschmidt, Chacornac, James Ferguson, Robert Pogson, E. W. Tempel, J. C. Watson, C. H. F. Peters, A. Borrelly, J. Palisa, the Henry brothers and Charlois.

In 1891, however, Max Wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with Brucia, whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, calling them vermin of the skies, a phrase due to Weiss.() Even a century later, only a few thousand asteroids were identified, numbered and named.

 Manual methods of the 1900s and modern reporting 
Until 1998, asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was photographed by a wide-field telescope, or Astrograph. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.()

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a provisional designation, made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discoverys sequential number (example: ).

The last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the Planet Center, where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the Astronomical Union.

 Computerized methods 
Image:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|framed|right|
FH is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an artificial satellite.
There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross Earths, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth (see asteroids). The three most important groups of asteroids are the Apollos, Amors, and Atens. Various deflection strategies have been proposed, as early as the 1960s.

The near-Earth asteroid Eros had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: Amor, Apollo, Adonis, and finally Hermes, which approached within 0.005 AU of the Earth in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of Alvarez hypothesis that an event resulted in the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction, and the 1994 observation of Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashing into Jupiter. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its military satellites, built to detect nuclear explosions, had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to 10 metres across.

All these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. Since 1998, a large majority of the asteroids have been discovered by such automated systems. A list of teams using such automated systems includes:()

* The Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) team
* The Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) team
* Spacewatch
* The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) team
* The Sky Survey (CSS)
* The Imperatore Near-Earth Objects Survey (CINEOS) team
* The Spaceguard Association
* The Asteroid Survey (ADAS)

The LINEAR system alone has discovered 121,346 asteroids, as of March, 2011.() Among all the automated systems, 4711 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered() including over 600 more than  in diameter.

 Terminology  

Traditionally, small bodies orbiting the Sun were classified as asteroids, comets or meteoroids, with anything smaller than ten metres across being called a meteoroid.() The term asteroid is ill-defined. It never had a formal definition, with the broader term planet being preferred by the Astronomical Union from 1853 on. In 2006, the term Solar System Body was introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets.(The definition of Small Solar System Bodies says that they include most of the Solar System asteroids, most trans-Neptunian objects, comets, and other small bodies. The Final IAU Resolution on the definition of planet ready for voting (IAU)) Other languages prefer planetoid (Greek for planet-like), and this term is occasionally used in English for the larger asteroids. The word planetesimal has a similar meaning, but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the Solar System was forming. The term planetule was coined by the  geologist Daniel Conybeare to describe minor planets,() but is not in common use. The three largest objects in the asteroid belt, Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta, grew to the stage of protoplanets. Ceres has been designated as a planet, the only one in the inner Solar System. 

When found, asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets, and there was no unified term for the two until Small Solar System Body was coined in 2006. The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroids. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most asteroids with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.(Weissman, Paul R., William F. Bottke, Jr., and Harold F. Levinson. Evolution of Comets into Asteroids. Southwest Research Institute, Planetary Science Directorate. 2002. Web Retrieved 3 Aug. 2010)

For almost two centuries, from the discovery of Ceres in 1801 until the discovery of the first centaur, Chiron, in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as Hidalgo ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit. When astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than Jupiter, now called centaurs, they numbered them among the traditional asteroids, though there was debate over whether they should be classified as asteroids or as a new type of object. Then, when the first object, QB1, was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: Kuiper-belt object, object, object, and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.

The innermost of these are the Kuiper-belt objects, called objects partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.(Are Kuiper Belt Objects asteroids?, Ask an astronomer, Cornell University) They are believed to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.(Asteroids and Comets, NASA website) Furthermore, most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets, and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei. (The much more distant cloud is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.) Other recent observations, such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the Stardust probe, are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids,(Comet Dust Seems More Asteroidy Scientific American, January 25, 2008) suggesting a continuum between asteroids and comets rather than a sharp dividing line.(Comet samples are surprisingly asteroid-like, New Scientist, 24 January 2008)

The minor planets beyond Jupiters orbit are sometimes also called asteroids, especially in popular presentations.(For instance, a joint NASA-JPL public-outreach website states:
 (See http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids))
However, it is becoming increasingly common for the term asteroid to be restricted to minor planets of the inner Solar System.( Therefore, this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids: objects of the belt, trojans, and objects.

When the IAU introduced the class Small Solar System Bodies in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets, they created the class of planets for the largest minor planetsthose that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity. According to the IAU, the term minor planet may still be used, but generally the term Small Solar System Body will be preferred.(Questions and Answers on Planets, IAU) Currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres, at about  across, has been placed in the dwarf planet category, although there are several large asteroids (Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea) that may be classified as dwarf planets when their shapes are better known.(Three new planets may join solar system, New Scientist, 16 August 2006)

 Formation 
It is believed that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the nebula until Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from resonances with Jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately  in diameter accreted during that early era, whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption.() Ceres and Vesta grew large enough to melt and differentiate, with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core, leaving rocky minerals in the crust.()

In the model, many Kuiper-belt objects are captured in the outer asteroid belt, at distances greater than 2.6 AU. Most were later ejected by Jupiter, but those that remained may be the asteroids, and possibly include Ceres.(William B. McKinnon, 2008, On The Possibility Of Large KBOs Being Injected Into The Outer Asteroid Belt. American Astronomical Society, DPS meeting #40, #38.03)

 Distribution within the Solar System 

Image:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|250px|thumb|right|The belt (white) and the asteroids (green)

Various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner Solar System. Their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the Solar System and by the effect. Significant populations include:

 Asteroid belt 


The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, generally in relatively low-eccentricity (i.e., not very elongated) orbits. This belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than  in diameter,(

) and millions of smaller ones.(
World Book at NASA
) These asteroids may be remnants of the disk, and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the Solar System was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by Jupiter.

 Trojans 


Trojan asteroids are a population that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two points of stability, L4 and L5, which lie 60 ahead of and behind the larger body.

The most significant population of Trojan asteroids are the Trojans. Although fewer Jupiter Trojans have been discovered as of 2010, it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt.

A couple trojans have also been found orbiting with Mars.(Neptune also has a few known trojans, and these are thought to actually be much more numerous than the Jovian trojans. However, they are often included in the trans-Neptunian population rather than counted with the asteroids.)

 Near-Earth asteroids 


Near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close    to that of Earth.  Asteroids that actually cross the Earths orbital path are known as Earth-crossers. As of May 2010, 7,075 near-Earth asteroids are known and the number over one kilometre in diameter is estimated to be 5001,000.

 Characteristics 
 Size distribution 


Asteroids vary greatly in size, from almost 1000 kilometres for the largest down to rocks just tens of metres across.(Below 10 metres, these rocks are by convention considered to be meteoroids.) The three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors,() and are thought to be surviving protoplanets. The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either surviving planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies.

The planet Ceres is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of . The next largest are Pallas and Vesta, both with diameters of just over . Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see Apophis.

The mass of all the objects of the belt, lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is estimated to be about 2.8-3.2 kg, or about 4 percent of the mass of the Moon. Of this, Ceres comprises 0.95 kg, a third of the total.() Adding in the next three most massive objects, Vesta (9%), Pallas (7%), and Hygiea (3%), brings this figure up to 51%; while the three after that, Davida (1.2%), Interamnia (1.0%), and Europa (0.9%), only add another 3% to the total mass. The number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.

The number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a law, there are bumps at 5 km and 100 km, where more asteroids than expected from a distribution are found.(Davis 2002, Asteroids III, cited by eljko Ivezi)



Largest asteroids

image:masses of asteroids vs main belt.png|thumb|300px|right|The relative masses of the twelve largest asteroids known,(Recent Asteroid Mass Determinations. Maintained by Jim Baer. Last updated 2010-12-12. Access date 2011-09-02. The values of Juno and Herculina may be off by as much as 16%, and Euphrosyne by a third. The order of the lower eight may change as better data is acquired, but the values do not overlap with any known asteroid outside these twelve.) compared to the remaining mass of the asteroid belt.(
) 






 









Although their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status, the four largest objects, Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea, are remnant protoplanets that share many characteristics common to planets, and are untypical compared to the majority of potato-shaped asteroids.



Ceres is the only asteroid large enough for its gravity to force it into a spheroidal shape, and so, according to the IAUs 2006 resolution on the definition of a planet, it has been classified as a planet.() Vesta may eventually be so classified as well. Ceres has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids, of around 3.32,() and may possess a surface layer of ice.() Like the planets, Ceres is differentiated: it has a crust, a mantle and a core.( Vesta, too, has a differentiated interior, though it formed inside the Solar Systems frost line, and so is devoid of water;

) its composition is mainly of basaltic rock such as olivine.( Pallas is unusual in that, like Uranus, it rotates on its side, with one pole regularly facing the Sun and the other facing away.() Its composition is similar to that of Ceres: high in carbon and silicon, and perhaps partially differentiated.() Hygiea is a carbonaceous asteroid and, unlike the other largest asteroids, lies relatively close to the of the ecliptic.

Rotation
Measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the main belt show that there is an upper limit. No asteroid with a diameter larger than 100 meters has a period of rotation faster than 2.2 hours. For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the inertia at the surface is greater than the gravitational force, so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are piles formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.()

 Composition 
The physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood. Ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta is thought to have a nickel-iron core, olivine mantle, and basaltic crust.(http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1995/20/image/) Hygiea, however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite, is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid. Most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though the largest are probably solid. Some asteroids have moons or are co-orbiting binaries: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered families are believed to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid.

Asteroids contain traces of amino-acids and other organic compounds, and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early Earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life, or may have even brought life itself to Earth. (See also panspermia.)(Life is Sweet: Sugar-Packing Asteroids May Have Seeded Life on Earth, Space.com, 19 December 2001) In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets in space.()()()

Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, which has a reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be naked-eye visible for a short time.(Closest Flyby of Large Asteroid to be Naked-Eye Visible, Space.com, 4 February 2005)

Composition is calculated from three primary sources: albedo, surface spectrum, and density. The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280 km in diameter, and include Hermione (268186183 km), and Sylvia (384262232 km). Only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 Sylvia, though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed Davida, the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar system: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.(Marchis, Descamps, et al. Icarus, Feb. 2011)

Surface features
Image:(253) mathilde.jpg|thumb|right|Mathilde, a asteroid measuring about  across, covered in craters half that size. Photograph taken in 1997 by the Shoemaker probe.
Most asteroids outside the big four (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance, if irregular in shape. 50-km Mathilde (shown at right) is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroids radius, and Earth-based observations of 300-km Davida, one of the largest asteroids after the big four, reveal a similarly angular profile, suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters.(A.R. Conrad et al. 2007. Direct measurement of the size, shape, and pole of 511 Davida with Keck AO in a single night, Icarus, doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2007.05.004) Medium-sized asteroids such as Mathilde and Ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface. Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid. Ceres seems quite different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will not be known until Dawn arrives in 2015.

 Classification 
Asteroids are commonly classified according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits, and features of their reflectance spectrum.

 Orbital classification 


Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.() Families have only been recognized within the belt. They were first recognised by Hirayama in 1918 and are often called families in his honor.

About 30% to 35% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids.  A family has also been associated with the plutoid planet .

 Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects 

Some asteroids have unusual orbits that are co-orbital with the Earth or some other planet. Examples are Cruithne and . The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between Saturns moons Epimetheus and Janus.

Sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become quasi-satellites for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and Venus are known to have quasi-satellites.

Such objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically Mercury, are a special class of asteroids.  However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.

 Spectral classification 
Image:433eros.jpg|thumb|right|This picture of Eros shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as  across can be seen.


In 1975, an asteroid taxonomic system based on colour, albedo, and spectral shape was developed by R. Chapman, Morrison, and Zellner.() These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroids surface material. The original classification system had three categories: C-types for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), S-types for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.

The two most widely used taxonomies now used are the Tholen classification and SMASS classification. The former was proposed in 1984 by J. Tholen, and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.() In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the M-type. There are also several smaller classes.()

Note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

 Problems 
Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroids composition.() However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications is in use. This has led to significant confusion. While asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.

At present, the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the 1990s is still the standard. Scientists cannot agree on a better taxonomic system, largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids (e.g. finer resolution spectra, or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful).

 Exploration 
Image:951 Gaspra.jpg|thumb|right|Gaspra is the first asteroid to be imaged in close-up.
imaged by the Dawn spacecraft
Until the age of space travel, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting Space Telescope can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their curves (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). Radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of delta v and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.(A Piloted Orion Flight to a Near-Earth Object: A Feasibility Study)

The first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971 when the 9 probe imaged Phobos and Deimos, the two small moons of Mars, which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the Voyager probes of the small moons of the giants.

The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was Gaspra in 1991, followed in 1993 by Ida and its moon Dactyl, all of which were imaged by the Galileo probe en route to Jupiter.

The first dedicated asteroid probe was Shoemaker, which photographed Mathilde in 1997, before entering into orbit around Eros, finally landing on its surface in 2001.

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include Braille (by Space 1 in 1999), and Annefrank (by Stardust in 2002).

In September 2005, the Japanese Hayabusa probe started studying Itokawa in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but returned samples of its surface to earth on June 13, 2010.

The European Rosetta probe (launched in 2004) flew by teins in 2008 and Lutetia, the second-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.

In September 2007, NASA launched the Dawn Mission, which started orbiting the protoplanet Vesta in July 2011, and is to orbit Ceres in 2015. 4 Vesta is the largest asteroid visited to date.

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth (mining), or materials for constructing habitats (see of the asteroids). Materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for manufacturing and construction.

 Fiction 


Asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories. Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places human beings might colonize, resources for extracting minerals, hazards encountered by spaceships traveling between two other points, and as a threat to life on Earth by potential impact.

 signature  Alfred Nobel Signature.svg


Alfred Bernhard Nobel () (21 October 1833  10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, innovator, and armaments manufacturer.  He is the inventor of dynamite.  Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. In his last will, he used his enormous fortune to institute the Prizes. The element nobelium was named after him. His name also survives in modern-day companies such as Nobel and Nobel, which are descendents of the companies Nobel himself established.

Personal background
Alfred Nobel was the third son of Nobel (18011872) and Andriette Ahlsell Nobel (18051889). Through his father he was a descendant of the famous Swedish scientist Olof Rudbeck (1630-1702).  Born in Stockholm on 21 October 1833, he went with his family to Petersburg in 1842, where his father (who had invented modern plywood) started a torpedo works. Alfred studied chemistry with Professor Nikolaevich Zinin. When Alfred was 18, he went to the United States to study chemistry for four years and worked for a short period under Ericsson.(Carlisle, Rodney (2004). Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries, p. 256. John Wiley &amp; Songs, Inc., New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-24410-4.) who designed the American Civil War ironclad Monitor.  In 1859, the factory was left to the care of the second son, Nobel (18311888), who greatly improved the business. Alfred, returning to Sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business, devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerine (discovered in 1847 by Sobrero, one of his fellow students under Pelouze at the of Turin). A big explosion occurred on the 3 September 1864 at their factory in Heleneborg in Stockholm, killing five people.  Among them was Alfreds younger brother Emil.

Though Nobel remained unmarried, his biographers note that he had at least three loves. Nobels first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra, who rejected his proposal. In 1876 Austro-Bohemian Countess Bertha Kinsky became Alfred Nobels secretary. But after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, for her sincere peace activities.

Nobels third and longest-lasting love was with a flower girl named Sofie Hess from Vienna. This liaison lasted for 18 years and in many of the exchanged letters, Nobel addressed his love as Madame Sofie Nobel. After his death, according to his biographers  Evlanoff and Fluor, and Fant  Nobels letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm and became the best-kept secret of the time. They were released only in 1955, to be included with the biographical data of Nobel.

The foundations of the Nobel Prize were laid in 1895 when Alfred Nobel wrote his last will, leaving much of his wealth for its establishment. Since 1901, the prize has honored men and women for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and for work in peace.

Sri Kantha has suggested that the one personal trait of Nobel that helped him to sharpen his creativity include his talent for information access, via his multi-lingual skills. Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: Swedish, French, Russian, English, German and Italian. He also developed literary skills to write poetry in English. His Nemesis, a prose tragedy in four acts about Cenci, partly inspired by Bysshe Shelleys Cenci, was printed while he was dying. The entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual SwedishEsperanto) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has been translated to Slovenian via the Esperanto version and to French.() In 2010 it was published in Russia as another bilingual (RussianEsperanto) edition. 

Nobel was elected a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an doctorate from University in 1893.

Alfred Nobel is buried in begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

Inventions


Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as dynamite. Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance Nobels Safety Powder, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for power.

Nobel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. Gelignite, or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the Age of Engineering bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An off-shoot of this research resulted in Nobels invention of ballistite, the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

The Prizes


In 1888 Alfreds brother Ludvig died while visiting Cannes and a French newspaper erroneously published Alfreds obituary. It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated  (The merchant of death is dead) and went on to say, Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday. Alfred was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered. On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the Prizes, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a stroke on 10 December 1896 at Sanremo, Italy. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobels will gave 31,225,000 kronor (equivalent to about 1.8 billion kronor or 250 million US dollars in 2008) to fund the prizes.

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence in physical science, in chemistry and in medical science or physiology; the fourth is for literary work in an ideal direction and the fifth prize is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international fraternity, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses. There is no prize awarded for mathematics,() but see Prize.

The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work in an ideal direction ( in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted ideal as idealistic () and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less Romantic authors, such as Ibsen and Tolstoy. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, Fo and Saramago, who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers, technicians or other inventors.

In 2001, Alfred Nobels great-grandnephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given in Alfred Nobels memory from the five other awards. This has caused much controversy whether the of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is actually a Nobel Prize / Peace Prize.

File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|280px|The Sphinx and the of Giza are among the most recognizable symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt.



Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC (according to Egyptian chronology)() with the political unification of and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh.(Dodson (2004) p. 46)  The of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods. The Kingdom of the Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Bronze Age and the Kingdom of the Bronze Age. Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the period, after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was conquered by a succession of foreign powers in this late period. In the aftermath of the Greats death, one of his generals, Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Dynasty ruled Egypt until 30 BC, when it fell to the Empire and became a Roman province.(Clayton (1994) p. 217)

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River Valley. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which fueled development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a Pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.(James (2005) p. 8)(Manuelian (1998) pp. 67)

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that facilitated the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships,( faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty.(Clayton (1994) p. 153) Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.(James (2005) p. 84)

History



The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.(Shaw (2002) pp. 17, 6769) The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.(Shaw (2002) p. 17)  Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120 thousand years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the region.

Predynastic period


In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated.( )

By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper Egypt, the Badari, was known for its high quality ceramics, tools, and its use of copper.(Hayes (1964) p. 220)

In Northern Egypt, the Badari was followed by Amratian and Gerzean cultures,(Childe, V. Gordon (1953), New light on the most ancient Near East (Praeger Publications)) which brought a number of technological improvements. In Gerzian times, early evidence exists of contact with Canaan and the Byblos coast.(Patai, Raphael (1998), Children of Noah: Jewish Seafaring in Ancient Times (Princeton Uni Press))

In southern Egypt, the Naqada culture, similar to the Badari, began to expand along the Nile by about 4000 BC. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes.(Barbara G. Aston, James A. Harrell, Ian Shaw (2000). Paul T. Nicholson and Ian Shaw editors. Stone, in Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology, Cambridge, 577, pp. 4647. Also note: Barbara G. Aston (1994). Ancient Egyptian Stone Vessels, Studien zur Archologie und Geschichte Altgyptens 5, Heidelberg, pp. 2326. (See on-line posts: http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/stone/obsidian.html and http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/obsidian.html.)) Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley.() Establishing a power center at Hierakonpolis, and later at Abydos, Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile.(Shaw (2002) p. 61) They also traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the Mediterranean to the east.(  Royal Nubian burials at Qustul produced artifacts bearing the oldest known examples of Egyptian dynastic symbols, such as the white crown of Egypt and falcon.()() 

The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines.() During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually evolved into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.(Allen (2000) p. 1)

Early Dynastic Period
The 3rd century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of pharaohs from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today.(Clayton (1994) p. 6) He chose to begin his official history with the king named Meni (or Menes in Greek) who was then believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Egypt (around 3100 BC).(Shaw (2002) pp. 7880) The transition to a unified state actually happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have actually been the pharaoh Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette in a symbolic act of unification.(Clayton (1994) pp. 1213) In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150 BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified their control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis, from which they could control the force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death.(Shaw (2002) p. 70) The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labor, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.()

of the Two Lands.(Robins (1997) p. 32)
Old Kingdom

Stunning advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the Kingdom, fueled by the increased productivity made possible by a well-developed central administration.(James (2005) p. 40)  Some of Ancient Egypts crowning achievements, the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx, were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve yield, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a justice system to maintain peace and order.(Shaw (2002) p. 102) Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. By the end of the Old Kingdom, five centuries of these feudal practices had slowly eroded the power of the pharaoh, who could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.(Shaw (2002) pp. 1167) As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC,() ultimately caused the country to enter a 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.(Clayton (1994) p. 69)
First Intermediate Period

After Egypts government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the countrys economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richera fact demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.(Shaw (2002) p. 120) In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.(Shaw (2002) p. 146)

Free from their loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and power. By 2160 BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055 BC the Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands and inaugurating a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.(Clayton (1994) p. 29)

Middle Kingdom





The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom restored the countrys prosperity and stability, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.(Shaw (2002) p. 148) Mentuhotep II and his 11th Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier I, upon assuming kingship at the beginning of the 12th Dynasty around 1985 BC, shifted the nations capital to the city of Itjtawy located in Faiyum.(Clayton (1994) p. 79) From Itjtawy, the pharaohs of the 12th Dynasty undertook a far-sighted reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in Nubia rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the Walls-of-the-Ruler, to defend against foreign attack.(Shaw (2002) p. 158)

Having secured military and political security and vast agricultural and mineral wealth, the nations population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in expressions of personal piety and what could be called a democratization of the afterlife, in which all people possessed a soul and could be welcomed into the company of the gods after death.(Shaw (2002) pp. 17982) Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style,( and the relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured
subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical perfection.(Robins (1997) p. 90)

The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, III, allowed Asiatic settlers into the delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later 13th and 14th dynasties. During this decline, the foreign Asiatic settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.(Shaw (2002) p. 188)

Second Intermediate Period and the Hyksos



Around 1785 BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, Asiatic immigrants living in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris seized control of the region and forced the central government to retreat to Thebes, where the pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.(Ryholt (1997) p. 310) The Hyksos (foreign rulers) imitated Egyptian models of government and portrayed themselves as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their Middle Bronze Age culture.(Shaw (2002) p. 189)

After their retreat, the Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Hyksos to the north and the Hyksos Nubian allies, the Kushites, to the south. After years of inaction tenuous, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555 BC ( The pharaohs Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians, but it was Kamoses successor, I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos presence in Egypt. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypts borders and secure her complete dominance of the East.(Shaw (2002) p. 224)



New Kingdom



The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbors. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.  When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC, Egypt extended from Niya in north Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.(James (2005) p. 48)  The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to legitimize her claim to the throne.() Her successful reign was marked by trading expeditions to Punt, an elegant temple, a colossal pair of obelisks and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Hatshepsuts nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III sought to erase her legacy near the end of his reign, possibly in retaliation for usurping his throne.(Clayton (1994) p. 108)

File:SFEC EGYPT ABUSIMBEL 2006-003.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Four colossal statues of II flank the entrance of his temple Simbel.

Around 1350 BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun god Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of other deities, and attacked the power of the priestly establishment.(Aldred (1988) p. 259) Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to foreign affairs and absorbed himself in his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, and the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb erased all mention of Akhenatens heresy, now known as the Period.(Cline (2001) p. 273)

Around 1279 BC, II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.(From his two principal wives and large harem, Ramesses II sired more than 100 children. Clayton (1994) p. 146) A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the of Kadesh and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around 1258 BC.(Tyldesley (2001) pp. 767) Egypts wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the Libyans and the Peoples. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of Syria and Palestine. The impact of external threats was exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery and civil unrest. The high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their growing power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.(James (2005) p. 54)

 Third Intermediate Period 

Following the death of XI in 1078 BC, Smendes assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in name only.(Cerny (1975) p. 645) During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under I in 945 BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis, and Kushites threatened from the south.

Drawing on millennia of interaction (trade, acculturation, occupation, assimilation, and war()) with Northern Egyptians,() the Kushite king Piye left his spiritual homeland in Napata and invaded Northern Egypt around 727 BC.  Piye easily seized control of Thebes and eventually the Delta(Shaw (2002) p. 345) and recorded the episode on his stela of victory.  Piye set the stage for subsequent 25th dynasty pharaohs,() such as Taharqa, to reunite the Two lands of Northern and Southern Egypt.  The reunited Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom.  The 25th dynasty ushered in a renaissance period for Ancient Egypt.()   Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms.  Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, Jebel Barkal, etc.()   It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.()()()

Egypts far-reaching prestige declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the Assyrian sphere of influence, and by 700 BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667 BC the Assyrians began their attack on Egypt. The reigns of both Kushite kings Taharqa and his successor, Tanutamun, were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom the Nubian rulers enjoyed several victories.(The Kushite Conquest of Egypt, Ancient~Sudan: Nubia.) Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and sacked the temples of Thebes.(Shaw (2002) p. 358)


Late Period

With no permanent plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. By 653 BC, the Saite king I was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypts first navy. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of Naukratis became the home of Greeks in the delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525 BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh III at the battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.(Shaw (2002) p. 383)

Following its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh dynasty, ended in 402 BC, and from 380343 BC the Thirtieth Dynasty ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt, which ended with the kingship of II. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the Thirty-First Dynasty, began in 343 BC, but shortly after, in 332 BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to the Great without a fight.(Shaw (2002) p. 385)

Ptolemaic Dynasty

In 332 BC, the Great conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexanders successors, the Ptolemies, was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Greek rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous of Alexandria.(Shaw (2002) p. 405) The of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city&amp;mdash;as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.(Shaw (2002) p. 411)

Greek culture did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities, such as Serapis, and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV.(Shaw (2002) p. 418) In addition, as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful Syrian opponents made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.(James (2005) p. 62)

Roman Period



File:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|left|100px|upright|The mummy portraits epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures.

Egypt became a province of the Empire in 30 BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.(James (2005) p. 63) Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.(Shaw (2002) p. 426)

Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.(Shaw (2002) p. 422) The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some of the Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.(

From the mid-1st century, Christianity took root in Alexandria as it was seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from paganism and threatened the popular religious traditions. This led to persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.(Shaw (2003) p. 431) In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.(The Church in Ancient Society, Henry Chadwick, p. 373, Oxford University Press US, 2001, ISBN 0-19-924695-5) Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.(Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D 100400, MacMullen, p. 63, Yale University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-300-03216-1) As a consequence, Egypts pagan culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak their language, the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.(Shaw (2002) p. 445)

Government and economy
Administration and commerce



The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the vizier, who acted as the kings representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives.(Manuelian (1998) p. 358) At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they houses of worship, but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nations wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers, who redistributed grain and goods.(Manuelian (1998) p. 363)

Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period, they did use a type of money-barter system,(Meskell (2004) p. 23) with standard sacks of grain and the deben, a weight of roughly  of copper or silver, forming a common denominator.(Manuelian (1998) p. 372) Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5 sacks (200 kg or 400 lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn 7 sacks (250 kg or 550 lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140 deben.( Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.( During the 5th century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of metal rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.(Walbank (1984) p. 125)

Social status
Egyptian society was highly stratified, and status was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or noble family that owned the land.(Manuelian (1998) p. 383) Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corve system.(James (2005) p. 136) Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, the so-called white kilt class in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.(Billard (1978) p. 109) The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. Slavery was known in ancient Egypt, but the extent and prevalence of its practice are unclear.()

The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes except slaves, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress.( Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun. Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, served only secondary roles in the temples, and were not as likely to be as educated as men.( Also see a BBC History article online for more information on equality in ancient Egypt.(A maintained BBC History article by Dr. Joann Fletcher (last updated 5Nov2009).)



Legal system
The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Maat.( Although no codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.() Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.( More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.(Oakes (2003) p. 472)

Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminals family.( Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a yes or no question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.(McDowell (1999) p. 168)

Agriculture





A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.(Manuelian (1998) p. 361)

Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.(Nicholson (2000) p. 514) From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.(Nicholson (2000) p. 506)

The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley, and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.(Nicholson (2000) p. 510) Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.(Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630)



Animals

The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.(Strouhal (1989) p. 117) Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry such as ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.(Manuelian (1998) p. 381) The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and they provided both honey and wax.(Nicholson (2000) p. 409)

The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden, and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual.( Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, and the camel, although known from the New Kingdom, was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period, but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land.( Dogs, cats and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.( During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.(Oakes (2003) p. 229)

Natural resources

Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and jewelry.(Greaves (1929) p. 123) Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster.(Lucas (1962) p. 413) Ore-bearing formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.(Nicholson (2000) p. 28) Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.(C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Sulfur. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC)

The Egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai.(Scheel (1989) p. 14) Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.(Nicholson (2000) p. 166) High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.(Nicholson (2000) p. 51)

Trade

The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the Predynastic Period, they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.(Shaw (2002) p. 72) An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.(Naomi Porat and Edwin van den Brink (editor), An Egyptian Colony in Southern Palestine During the Late Predynastic to Early Dynastic, in The Nile Delta in Transition: 4th to 3rd Millennium BC (1992), pp. 433440.) Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.(Naomi Porat, Local Industry of Egyptian Pottery in Southern Palestine During the Early Bronze I Period, in Bulletin of the Egyptological, Seminar 8 (1986/1987), pp. 109129. See also University College London web post, 2000.)

By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian trade with Byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.(Shaw (2002) p. 322) Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lazuli, which had to be imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypts Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of oil.(Manuelian (1998) p. 145) In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.(Harris (1990) p. 13)

Language


Historical development



The language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and languages.(Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137) It has the second longest history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of Ancient Egyptian are Egyptian, Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.(Loprieno (2004) p. 161) Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.(Loprieno (2004) p. 162)

Ancient Egyptian was a language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian develops prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replace the older inflectional suffixes. There is a change from the older verbsubjectobject order to subjectverbobject.(Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137-38) The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Arabic.(Vittman (1991) pp. 197227)

Sounds and grammar

Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Later Egyptian to about nine.(Loprieno (1995a) p. 46) The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the person. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton  is the semantic core of the word hear; its basic conjugation is  he hears. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:(Loprieno (1995a) p. 74)  the woman hears.

Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic.(Loprieno (2004) p. 175) The word order is  in verbal and adjectival sentences, and  in nominal and adverbial sentences.(Allen (2000) pp. 67, 70, 109) The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.(Loprieno (2005) p. 2147) Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n, but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).(Loprieno (2004) p. 173)

Writing



Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|upright|The Rosetta stone (ca 196 BC) enabled linguists to begin the process of hieroglyph decipherment.(Allen (2000) p. 13)

Hieroglyphic writing dates to c. 3200 BC, and is composed of some 500 symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writingalong with formal hieroglyphsthat accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.

Around the 1st century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs.(Allen (2000) p. 7) Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the 4th century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine(Loprieno (2004) p. 166) and Islamic periods in Egypt,(El-Daly (2005) p. 164) but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.(Allen (2000) p. 8)

Literature



Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Edwin Smith surgical papyrus (ca 16th century BC) describes anatomy and medical treatments and is written in hieratic.

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.(Strouhal (1989) p. 235) Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the Pyramid and Texts, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC. Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of Harkhuf and Weni. The genre known as Sebayt (Instructions) was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the Ipuwer papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing disasters and social upheaval, is a famous example.

The of Sinuhe, written in Egyptian, might be the classic of Egyptian literature.(Lichtheim (1975) p. 11) Also written at this time was the Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.(Lichtheim (1975) p. 215) The of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature.(Wisdom in Ancient Israel, John Day,/John Adney Emerton,/Robert P. Gordon/ Hugh Godfrey/Maturin Williamson, p23, Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-521-62489-4) Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the of Wenamun and the of Any. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Graeco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as II.(Lichtheim (1980) p. 159)

Culture
 Daily life 





Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling flour and a small oven for baking bread.(Manuelian (1998) p. 401) Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.(Manuelian (1998) p. 403)

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness, and aromatic perfumes and ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.(Manuelian (1998) p. 405) Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the familys income.(Manuelian (1998) pp. 4067)

Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, and drums and imported lutes and lyres from Asia.() The sistrum was a rattle-like instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. Senet, a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was mehen, which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and games were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Hasan.(Manuelian (1998) p. 126) The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers village of el-Madinah has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community can be studied in such detail.(The Cambridge Ancient History: II Part I , The Middle East and the Aegean Region, c.1800-13380 B.C, Edited I.E.S EdwardsC.JGaddN.G.L Hammond-E.Sollberger, Cambridge at the University Press, p. 380, 1973, ISBN 0-521-08230-7)

Cuisine


Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed, the cuisine of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.(Manuelian (1998) pp. 399400)



Architecture


F-E-CAMERON EGYPT 2006 FEB 00289.JPG|thumb|The well preserved Temple of Horus at Edfu is an exemplar of Egyptian architecture.
The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large structures with accuracy and precision.(Clarke (1990) pp. 947)

The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in Malkata and Amarna, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs.(Badawy (1968) p. 50) Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of bricks. The architectural elements used in the worlds first large-scale stone building, Djosers mortuary complex, include and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.

The earliest preserved ancient temples, such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the pylon, the open courtyard, and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temples sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Graeco-Roman period.() The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs.(Dodson (1991) p. 23)  The 25th dynasty was a notable exception, as all 25th dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids.()()()

Art

30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|upright|The Bust of Nefertiti, by the sculptor Thutmose, is one of the most famous masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.

The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.(Robins (1997) p. 29) These artistic standardssimple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depthcreated a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.(Robins (1997) p. 21) Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.(Robins (2001) p. 12)

Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone to carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.(Nicholson (2000) p. 105) Pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of art, such as shabti statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.(James (2005) p. 122) During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.(Robins (1998) p. 74)

Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris.(Shaw (2002) p. 216) The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenatens revolutionary religious ideas.(Robins (1998) p. 149) This style, known as art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenatens death and replaced by the traditional forms.(Robins (1998) p. 158)

Religious beliefs




File:BD Hunefer.jpg|thumb|300px|The of the Dead was a guide to the deceaseds journey in the afterlife.

Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting creation myths and stories into a coherent system.(James (2005) p. 102) These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.(The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology, edited by B. Redford, p. 106, Berkley, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X)

File:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The statue provided a physical place for the Ka to manifest.

Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the kings behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the gods domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.(James (2005) p. 117) After the New Kingdom, the pharaohs role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.(Shaw (2002) p. 313)

The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects. In addition to the body, each person had a wt (shadow), a ba (personality or soul), a ka (life-force), and a name.(Allen (2000) pp. 79, 945) The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the blessed dead, living on as an akh, or effective one. For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a feather of truth. If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.(Wasserman, et al. (1994) pp. 1503)

File:tutmask.jpg|thumb|upright|Pharaohs tombs were provided with vast quantities of wealth, such as this golden mask from the mummy of Tutankhamun.

Burial customs


The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.( Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in jars.()



By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.()

Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, books of the dead were included in the grave, along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.() Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.(James (2005) p. 124)

 Military 



File:Egyptian-Chariot.png|thumb|right|An Egyptian chariot.

The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypts domination in the Near East. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant.(Shaw (2002) p. 245)

Typical military equipment included bows and arrows, spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the Khopesh was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.(Manuelian (1998) pp. 36667) The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army, it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as Tao II and his sons, did do so.(Clayton (1994) p. 96) although it has also been argued that kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops.() Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.(Shaw (2002) p. 400)

Technology, medicine, and mathematics

Technology

In technology, medicine and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism, as evidenced by the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri (c. 1600 BC), is first credited to Egypt, and the roots of the scientific method can also be traced back to the ancient Egyptians. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.


Faience and glass
Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience, which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper.(Nicholson (2000) p. 177) The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.(Nicholson (2000) p. 109)

The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.(Nicholson (2000) p. 195) It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.(Nicholson (2000) p. 215)

Medicine


The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The life-long labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).(Filer (1995) p. 94)

The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted periodontal disease.(Filer (1995) pp. 7880) Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.(Filer (1995) p. 21) Adult expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.(Figures are given for adult life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy at birth. Filer (1995) p. 25)

Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, like Imhotep, remained famous long after their deaths.(Filer (1995) p. 39) Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.(Strouhal (1989) p. 243) Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or House of Life institution, most notably those headquartered in Per-Bastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and Sas in the Late period. papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.(Stroual (1989) pp. 24446)

Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,(Stroual (1989) p. 250) while opium was used to relieve pain. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until he died.(Filer (1995) p. 38)

Shipbuilding

Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3000 BC. The Institute of America reports(Ward, Cheryl. Worlds Oldest Planked Boats, in Archaeology (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). Archaeological Institute of America.) that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the Abydos boats. These are a group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos that were constructed of wooden planks sewn together. Discovered by Egyptologist David OConnor of York University,(Schuster, Angela M.H. This Old Boat, 11 December 2000. Archaeological Institute of America.) woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together,( and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.( Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy,( originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC,( and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating.( The ship dating to 3000 BC was  long( and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh.( According to professor OConnor, the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to Pharaoh Aha.(

Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together, using pitch for caulking the seams. The ship, a 43.6-meter vessel sealed into a pit in the pyramid complex at the foot of the Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a barque. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with and tenon joints.( Despite the ancient Egyptians ability to construct very large boats to sail along the easily navigable Nile, they were not known as good sailors and did not engage in widespread sailing or shipping in the Mediterranean or Red Seas.

 Mathematics 



The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed system.(Understanding of Egyptian mathematics is incomplete due to paucity of available material and lack of exhaustive study of the texts that have been uncovered. Imhausen et al. (2007) p. 13) The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor and grain.(Imhausen et al. (2007) p. 11) Texts such as the Mathematical Papyrus and the Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operationsaddition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionuse fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, circles and even spheres. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of equations.(Clarke (1990) p. 222)

 eradefault

notation was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.(Clarke (1990) p. 217) Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this.(Clarke (1990) p. 218) Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph&amp;mdash;the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.(Gardiner (1957) p. 197)

Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had a grasp of the principles underlying the theorem, knowing, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 345 ratio.(Strouhal (1989) p. 241) They were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:

:Area  ()D2  ()r 2  3.16r 2,

a reasonable approximation of the formula r 2.((Imhausen et al. (2007) p. 31)

The ratio seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including the pyramids, but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.(Kemp (1989) p. 138)

 Legacy 






The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.(Siliotti (1998) p. 8) The Romans also imported materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.(Siliotti (1998) p. 10) 

During the Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam, but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as al-Misri and al-Maqrizi.(El-Daly (2005) p. 112) In the 17th and 18th centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.(Siliotti (1998) p. 13) 

Although the European colonial occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the countrys historical legacy, some foreigners had more positive results. Napoleon, for example, arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypts history, which was published in the Description de lgypte.(Siliotti (1998) p. 100) 

In the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The Council of Antiquities now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.

Antimony ( ;(In the UK, the variable vowel  is usually pronounced as a schwa ; in the US, it is generally a full .) ) is a toxic element with the symbol Sb and an number of 51.  A lustrous grey metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the mineral stibnite (Sb2S3).  Although the use of antimony is limited by its toxicity, its compounds have been of fundamental value in chemistry  a prominent example being the development of superacids derived from pentafluoride.(  Antimony compounds are prominent retardants found in many commercial and domestic products.  Certain alloys are valuable for use in solders and bearings.  An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics.

History
File:antimony-symbol.svg|left|70px|thumb|altAn unshaded circle surmounted by a cross.|One of the symbols for antimony
Antimonys sulfide compound, sulfide, Sb2S3 was recognized in antiquity, at least as early as 3000 BC.

An artefact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at Tello, Chaldea (part of present-day Iraq), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in Egypt.( One contemporary (Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone, published in 1892) was reported() to comment that we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal, which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase, and therefore this remarkable find must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable.(  However, Moorey was unconvinced that the artefact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Telloh object (published in 1975), attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony (i.e. native metal) and that the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments.(  This weakens the evidence for a lost art of rendering antimony malleable.

The first European description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book la pirotechnia of 1540 by Biringuccio. This book predates the more famous 1556 book by Agricola, re metallica, even though Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony.  A text describing the preparation of metallic antimony that was published in Germany in 1604 purported to date from the early fifteenth century, and if authentic it would predate Biringuccio. The book, written in Latin, was called Currus Triumphalis Antimonii (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), and its putative author was a certain Benedictine monk, writing under the name Valentinus.(Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von Leibniz, after careful inquiry, concluded that the work was spurious, that there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the books author was its ostensible editor, Johann Thlde (ca. 1565-ca. 1624). There is now agreement among professional historians that the Currus Triumphalis... was written after the middle of the sixteenth century and that Thlde was likely its author.)(s.v. Basilius Valentinus. Harold Jantz was perhaps the only modern scholar to deny Thldes authorship, but he too agrees that the work dates from after 1550: see his catalogue of German Baroque literature.) An English translation of the Triumphalis appeared in English in 1660, under the title Triumphant Chariot of Antimony. The work remains of great interest, chiefly because it documents how followers of the renegade German physician, Philippus Theophrastus Paracelsus von Hohenheim (of whom Thlde was one), came to associate the practice of alchemy with the preparation of chemical medicines.

Pure antimony was well known to ibn Hayyn, sometimes called the Father of Chemistry, in the 8th century. Here there is still an open controversy: Berthelot, who translated a number of Jbirs books, stated that antimony is never mentioned in them, but other authors() claim that Berthelot translated only some of the less important books, while the more interesting ones (some of which might describe antimony) are not yet translated, and their content is completely unknown.

The first natural occurrence of pure antimony (native antimony) in the crust was described by the Swedish scientist and local mine district engineer von Swab in 1783. The type-sample was collected from the Silver Mine in the Bergslagen mining district of Sala, Vstmanland, Sweden.()

Etymology
The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, kohl, the sulfide of antimony. the Elder, however, distinguishes between male and female forms of antimony; his male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, is probably native metallic antimony.(Pliny, Natural history, 33.33; W.H.S. Jones, the Classical Library translator, supplies a note suggesting the identifications.)

The Egyptians called antimony mdmt; in hieroglyphs, the vowels are uncertain, but there is an Arabic tradition that the word is  mesdemet.()( quotes Meyerhof, the translator of the book he is reviewing.) The Greek word,  stimmi, is probably a word from Arabic or Egyptian sdm O34:D46-G17-F21:D4, and is used by the Attic tragic poets of the 5th century BC; later Greeks also used  stibi, as did Celsus and Pliny, writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names stimi sic, larbaris, alabaster, and the very common platyophthalmos, wide-eye (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as stibium. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as     ithmid, athmoud, othmod, or uthmod. Littr suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from stimmida, (one) accusative for stimmi.(LSJ, s.v., vocalisation, spelling, and declension vary; Endlich, p.28; Celsus, 6.6.6 ff; Pliny Natural History 33.33; Lewis and Short: Latin Dictionary. OED, s. antimony.)

The use of Sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to the 18th century chemical pioneer, Jakob Berzelius, who used this abbreviation of the name stibium.(In his long article on chemical reactions and nomenclature -- Jns Jacob Berzelius, Essay on the cause of chemical proportions, and on some circumstances relating to them:  together with a short and easy method of expressing them, Annals of Philosophy, vol. 2, pages 443-454 (1813) and vol. 3, pages 51-62, 93-106, 244-255, 353-364 (1814) -- on page 52, Berzelius lists the symbol for antimony as St ; however, starting on page 248, Berzelius subsequently uses the symbol Sb for antimony.) The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late Greek, take their names, is antimonium. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The popular etymology, from  anti-monachos or French antimoine, still has adherents; this would mean monk-killer, and is explained by many early alchemists being monks, and antimony being poisonous.(The use of a symbol resembling an upside down female symbol for antimony could also hint at a satirical pun in this origin) So does the hypothetical Greek word  antimonos, against one, explained as not found as metal, or not found unalloyed.(Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 5th ed. 2004. Entry for antimony.)( Fernando even derives it from the story of how Basil Valentine and his fellow monastic alchemists poisoned themselves by working with antimony; antimonium is found two centuries before his time. Popular etymology from OED; as for antimonos, the pure negative would be more naturally expressed by a- not.)
Lippmann conjectured a Greek word,  anthemonion, which would mean floret, and he cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological efflorescence.(Lippman, pp. 6435)

The early uses of antimonium include the translations, in 10501100, by the African of Arabic medical treatises.(Lippman, p. 642, writing in 1919, says zuerst.) Several authorities believe that antimonium is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from ithmid;(Meyerhof as quoted in Sarton, asserts that ithmid or athmoud became corrupted in the medieval traductions barbaro-latines.; the OED asserts that some Arabic form is the origin, and
if ithmid is the root, posits athimodium, atimodium, atimonium, as intermediate forms.) other possibilities include Athimar, the Arabic name of the metal, and a hypothetical as-stimmi, derived from or parallel to the Greek.(Endlich, p.28; one of the advantages of as-stimmi would be that it has a whole syllable in common with antimonium.)

Characteristics
Properties

massive.jpg|thumb|altAn irregular piece of silvery stone with spots of variation in lustre and shade.|Native antimony with oxidation products
Antimony is in the group (group 15) and has an electronegativity of 2.05. As expected by periodic trends, it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth, and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic.

Antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to form trioxide, Sb2O3.

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metal that has a scale hardness of 3. Therefore, antimony by itself is never used to make hard objects: a coin made of antimony, issued in Chinas Guizhou province in 1931, was unpopular because they would wear out fast. After the first issue no others were produced.() It is resistant to attack by acids.

Four allotropes of antimony are known: a stable metallic form, and three meta-stable forms: explosive, black and yellow. Metallic antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metal. When molten antimony is slowly cooled, metallic antimony crystallizes in an hexagonal cell, isomorphic with that of the black allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony(III) trichloride. When scratched with a sharp implement, an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes given off as metallic antimony is formed; alternatively, when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed when gaseous metallic antimony is rapidly cooled. It oxidizes in air and is sometimes spontaneously combustible. At 100 C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of stibine (SbH3) at 90 C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this meta stable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.()

Isotopes

Antimony exists as two stable isotopes, 121Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and 123Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is 125Sb with a half-life of 2.75 years. In addition, 29 metastable states have been characterised.

Occurrence

The abundance of antimony in the Earths crust is estimated at 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million, comparable to thallium at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm.() Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 mineral species. Antimony is sometimes found native, but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite (Sb2S3) which is the predominant ore mineral. Commercial forms of antimony are generally ingots, broken pieces, granules, and cast cake. Other forms are powder, shot, and crystals.

In 2005, the Peoples Republic of China was the top producer of antimony with about 84% world share followed at a distance by South Africa, Bolivia and Tajikistan, reports the Geological Survey. The mine with the largest deposits in China is Mine in Hunan province with a estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.()

Production


The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality of the ore, which is usually a sulfide.  The sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered from roasting.(  This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide.  Antimony can be isolated from its ore by a reduction with scrap iron:
: + 3Fe  2Sb + 3FeS

Isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction:()

:2  +  3 C      4 Sb  +  3

Compounds

Antimony compounds are often classified into those of Sb(III) and Sb(V).(  Relative to its neighboring element As, the 5+ oxidaton state is more stable.

Oxides and hydroxides
trioxide () is formed when antimony is burnt in air.()
In the gas phase, this compound exists as , but it polymerises upon condensing.(  pentoxide, () can only be formed by oxidation by concentrated acid.() Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, tetroxide (), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V).( Unlike phosphorus and arsenic, these various oxides are amphoteric and do not form well-defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts.

Antimonous acid  is unknown but the conjugate base sodium antimonite () forms upon fusing oxide and .( Transition metal antimonites are also known.() Antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate , forming salts containing the antimonate anion . Dehydrating metal salts containing this anion yields mixed oxides.(

Many antimony ores are sulfides, including stibnite (), pyrargyrite (), zinkenite, jamesonite, and boulangerite.( pentasulfide is non-stoichiometric and features antimony in the +3 state and S-S bonds.() Several thioantimonides are known such as  and .()

Halides
Antimony forms two series of halides,  and . The trihalides , , , and  are all molecular compounds having pyramidal molecular geometry. The trifluoride  is prepared by the reaction of  with HF:(
:  +  6 HF    2   +  3 

It is acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions  and . Molten  is a weak conductor.  The trichloride  is prepared by dissolving  in acid:
:  +  6 HCl    2   +  3

The pentahalides  and  have bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase,  is polymeric, whereas  is monomeric.()  is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the superacid acid (HSbF6).

Oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus. Antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form antimony oxo- (antimonyl) compounds such as SbOCl and .(

Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds
Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb3-.  Antimony forms antimonides with metals, such as antimonide (InSb), and silver antimonide ().(  The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, e.g. Na3Sb and Zn3Sb2, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas stibine, :()
: + 3   
Stibine can also be produced by treating  salts with hydride reagents such as borohydride. Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature.  Because stibine is thermodynamically unstable (positive of formation), antimony does not react with hydrogen directly.(Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.)

Organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with reagents.(Elschenbroich, C. Organometallics (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-29390-6)  A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations.  Examples include Sb(C6H5)3 (triphenylstibine), Sb2(C6H5)4 (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic Sb(C6H5)n.  Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(C6H5)5 and several related halides.

Applications
Flame retardants
The main use of antimony is in the form of trioxide is used in the making of flame-proofing compounds. Markets for these flame-retardant applications include childrens clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers. It is also used in the fiberglass composites industry as an additive to resins for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn while a flame is held to it but will extinguish itself as soon as the flame is removed.  Fireproofing consumes about half of the annual production of antimony.(Sabina C. Grund, Kunibert Hanusch, Hans J. Breunig, Hans Uwe Wolf Antimony and Antimony Compounds in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )

Alloys
Antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead, increasing its hardness and mechanical strength.  The Sb-Pb alloy is used in lead-acid batteries.(() It is used in antifriction alloys, such as metal.() It is used as an alloy in bullets and shot,  cable sheathing, metal (e.g. for linotype printing machines()), solder  some lead-free solders contain 5% Sb,() in pewter,() and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of pipes.

Other applications
The second main application is as a catalyst for the production of the polymer polyethyleneterephthalate.  It is an additive in some glasses.  In the latter application, antimony oxides serve as fining agents, aiding in the removal of microscopic bubbles.  This application is mainly used for TV screens.(Bernard H.W. S. De Jong, Ruud G. C. Beerkens, Peter A. van Nijnatten Glass in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )

Niche applications
Microelectronics
In tiny amounts, antimony is increasingly being used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant for ultra-high conductivity n-type silicon wafers() in the production of diodes, infrared detectors, and Hall-effect devices.

In the 1950s, tiny beads of a lead-antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of NPN junction transistors with antimony.()

Medical
Few biological or medical applications exist for antimony. Treatments principally containing antimony are known as antimonials and are used as emetics.

Antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs. Antimony potassium tartrate, or tartar emetic, was once used as an anti-schistosomal drug, subsequently replaced by praziquantel.

Antimony and its compounds are used in several veterinary preparations like anthiomaline or lithium antimony thiomalate, which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants.

Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues, at least in animals.
Antimony-based drugs, such as antimoniate, are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in animals. Unfortunately, as well as having low therapeutic indices, the drugs are poor at penetrating the marrow, where some of the Leishmania amastigotes reside, and so cure of the disease  especially the visceral form  is very difficult.

Elemental antimony as an pill was once used as a medicine. It could be reused by others after ingestion.

Other uses
In the heads of some safety matches () and in reactors together with beryllium as neutron sources.

Antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials.()

The semiconductor nitride doped with antimony has been proposed on theoretical grounds as being able to catalyze the splitting of water into H2 and O2.()

Precautions
Antimony and many of its compounds are toxic, and the effects of antimony poisoning are similar to poisoning. Inhalation of antimony dust is harmful and in certain cases may be fatal; in small doses, antimony causes headaches, dizziness, and depression. Larger doses such as prolonged skin contact may cause dermatitis; otherwise it can damage the kidneys and the liver, causing violent and frequent vomiting, and will lead to death in a few days.

Antimony is incompatible with strong oxidizing agents, strong acids, halogen acids, chlorine, or fluorine. It should be kept away from heat.(MSDS, Baker)

Antimony leaches from terephthalate (PET) bottles into liquids.() While levels observed for water are below water guidelines,()() juice concentrates (for which no guidelines are established) produced in the UK were found to contain up to 44.7 g/L of antimony, well above the EU limits for water of 5 g/L.()()  The guidelines are:
*Health Organization: 20 g/L
*Japan: 15 g/L(Wakayama, Hiroshi, Revision of Drinking Water Standards in Japan, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (Japan), 2003; Table 2, p. 84)
*States Environmental Protection Agency, Health Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Environment: 6 g/L
*German Federal Ministry of Environment: 5 g/L(

Aluminium or aluminum is a silvery white member of the group of elements. It has the symbol Al, and its number is 13. It is not soluble in water under normal circumstances.
Aluminium is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon), and the most abundant metal, in the Earths crust. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earths solid surface. Aluminium metal is too reactive chemically to occur natively. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals.() The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite.

Aluminium is remarkable for the metals low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials. The most useful compounds of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, are the oxides and sulfates.

Despite its prevalence in the environment, aluminium salts are not known to be used by any form of life. In keeping with its pervasiveness, it is well tolerated by plants and animals.(  Because of its prevalence, potential biological roles, beneficial and otherwise, for aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.

 Characteristics 


 Physical 
Aluminium is a soft, durable, lightweight, ductile and malleable metal with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. Aluminium is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium film serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of light and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far infrared radiation. The yield strength of pure aluminium is 711 MPa, while alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.() Aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel. It is easily machined, cast, drawn and extruded.

Corrosion resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper.( This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced when many aqueous salts are present, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

Aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. Aluminium has a energy of approximately 200 mJ/m2.()

Aluminium is one of the few metals that retain full silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of silver-colored paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200400 nm (UV) and the 3,00010,000 nm (far IR) regions; in the 400700 nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the 7003000 (near IR) by silver, gold, and copper.()

Aluminium is a good thermal and conductor, having 59% the conductivity of copper, both thermal and electrical. Aluminium is capable of being a superconductor, with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 Kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about 100 gauss (10 milliteslas).()

 Creation 
Stable aluminium is created when hydrogen fuses with magnesium either in large stars or in supernovae.()

 Isotopes 

Aluminium has many known isotopes, whose mass numbers range from 21 to 42; however, only 27Al (isotope) and 26Al (radioactive isotope, t1/2  7.2105 y) occur naturally. 27Al has a natural abundance above 99.9%. 26Al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic-ray protons. Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating marine sediments, manganese nodules, glacial ice, quartz in rock exposures, and meteorites. The ratio of 26Al to 10Be has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, sediment storage, burial times, and erosion on 105 to 106 year time scales.() Cosmogenic 26Al was first applied in studies of the Moon and meteorites. Meteoroid fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial 26Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding drastically reduces 26Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorites terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that 26Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26Al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.()

 Natural occurrence 
In the crust, aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by weight) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon).(, p. 217) Because of its strong affinity to oxygen, it is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates. Feldspars, the most common group of minerals in the Earths crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes.() Native aluminium has been reported in seeps in the northeastern slope of the China Sea and Chen et al. (2011)( have proposed a theory of its origin as resulting by reduction from tetrahydroxoaluminate Al(OH)4- to metallic aluminium by bacteria.(Chen Z., Huang C.-Y., Zhao M., Yan W., Chien C.-W., Chen M., Yang H., Machiyama H. &amp; Lin S. (2011). Characteristics and possible origin of native aluminum in cold seep sediments from the northeastern South China Sea. of Asian Earth Sciences 40(1): 363-370. doi:doi:10.1016/j.jseaes.2010.06.006.)

It also occurs in the minerals beryl, cryolite, garnet, spinel and turquoise. Impurities in Al2O3, such as chromium or iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire, respectively.

Although aluminium is an extremely common and widespread element, the common aluminium minerals are not economic sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite (AlOx(OH)3-2x). Bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions.() Large deposits of bauxite occur in Australia, Brazil, Guinea and Jamaica and the primary mining areas for the ore are in Australia, Brazil, China, India, Guinea,  Indonesia, Jamaica, Russia and Surinam. 


 Production and refinement 

Although aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the Earths crust, it is never found in free, metallic form (with above mentioned exceptions).

Aluminium forms strong bonds with oxygen. Compared to most other metals, it is difficult to extract from ore, such as bauxite, due to the energy required to reduce aluminium oxide (Al2O3). For example, direct reduction with carbon, as is used to produce iron, is not chemically possible, since aluminium is a stronger reducing agent than carbon. There is an indirect carbothermic reduction possible by using carbon and Al2O3, which forms an intermediate Al4C3 and this can further yield aluminium metal at a temperature of 19002000C. This process is still under development. This process costs less energy and yields less CO2 than the process, the major industrial process for aluminium extraction.() Aluminium oxide has a melting point of about . Therefore, it must be extracted by electrolysis. In this process, the aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite with calcium fluoride and then reduced to the pure metal. The operational temperature of the reduction cells is around . Cryolite is found as a mineral in Greenland, but in industrial use it has been replaced by a synthetic substance. Cryolite is a chemical compound of aluminium and sodium fluorides: (Na3AlF6). The aluminium oxide (a white powder) is obtained by refining bauxite in the process of Bayer. (Previously, the process was the predominant refining technology.)

The electrolytic process replaced the process, which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium. Both of the electrodes used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon. Once the refined alumina is dissolved in the electrolyte, its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the cathode is:

: Al3+ + 3 e  Al

Here the aluminium ion is being reduced. The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off, usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing.

At the anode, oxygen is formed:
: 2 O2  O2 + 4 e

To some extent, the carbon anode is degraded by the oxygen. The anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process. The cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes and metal movement. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear.


Aluminium electrolysis with the Hall-Hroult process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 150.5 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 MJ/kg). The most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8 kWh/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the of reaction, 31 MJ/kg, and the free energy of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kiloamperes; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.

The Hall-Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the process. The process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.(William B. Frank, Warren E. Haupin, Robert K. Dawless, Douglas A. Granger, Maurice W. Wei, Kenneth J. Calhoun, Thomas B. Bonney
Aluminum in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2009, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )()

Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the U.S.( Smelters tend to be situated where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive, such as the Arab Emirates with excess natural gas supplies and Iceland and Norway with energy generated from renewable sources. The worlds largest smelters of alumina are Peoples Republic of China, Russia, and Quebec and Columbia in Canada.()()()



In 2005, the Peoples Republic of China was the top producer of aluminium with almost a one-fifth world share, followed by Russia, Canada, and the USA, reports the Geological Survey.

Over the last 50 years, Australia has become a major producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina (before being overtaken by China in 2007).(() Australia produced 62 million tonnes of bauxite in 2005. The Australian deposits have some refining problems, some being high in silica, but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine.()

 Recycling 
File:41 ALU Recycling Code.svg|150px|thumb|Aluminium code

Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. According to the Resource Panels Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics etc.) is 80kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (350500kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (35kg per capita). Knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling.

Recovery of the metal via recycling has become an important facet of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium cans brought it to the public awareness.

Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as dross (ash-like oxide).() The dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium.

In Europe aluminium experiences high rates of recycling, ranging from 42% of beverage cans, 85% of construction materials and 95% of transport vehicles.()

Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections. Another important use is for extrusion.

White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially.() The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others, hydrogen, acetylene, and ammonia), which spontaneously ignites on contact with air;() contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, the waste has found use as a filler in asphalt and concrete.(Dunster, A.M., Moulinier, F., Abbott, B., Conroy, A., Adams, K., Widyatmoko, D.(2005). Added value of using new industrial waste streams as secondary aggregates in both concrete and asphalt. DTI/WRAP Aggregates Research Programme STBF 13/15C. The Waste and Resources Action Programme.)

 Compounds 
 Oxidation state +3 
The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The coordination number of such compounds varies, but generally Al3+ is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless.(

 Halides 
All four trihalides are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, fluoride (AlF3) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF3 is related to the compactness of fluoride ion, six of which can fit around the small Al3+ centre. AlF3 sublimes (with cracking) at . With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist. Acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centres, which are feature both halide and aquo ligands. When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as , , and . In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)127+.

 Oxide and hydroxides 
Aluminium forms one stable oxide, known by its mineral name corundum.  Sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides (AlO(OH) are boehmite and diaspore. There are three trihydroxides: bayerite, gibbsite, and nordstrandite, which differ in their crystalline structure (polymorphs). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundrum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful.

 Carbide, nitride, and related materials 
carbide (Al4C3) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above . The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centres. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane. The acetylide, Al2(C2)3, is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium.

nitride (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral Al centres. It can be made from the elements at . It is air-stable material with a usefully high conductivity. phosphide (AlP) is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give phosphine:
: AlP  +  3 H2O      Al(OH)3  +  PH3

 Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides 

image:Trimethylaluminium-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|220px|Structure of trimethylaluminium, a compound that features five-coordinate carbon.
A variety of compounds of empirical formula AlR3 and AlR1.5Cl1.5 exist.(Elschenbroich, C. Organometallics (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-29390-6) These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centres, e.g. trimethylaluminium has the formula Al2(CH3)6 (see figure). With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as triisobutylaluminium. Such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric. Few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds except for large organic groups.

The important aluminium hydride is aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), which is used in as a reducing agent in chemistry. It can be produced from hydride and aluminium trichloride:
: 4 LiH  +  AlCl3      LiAlH4  +  3 LiCl
Several useful derivatives of LiAlH4 are known, e.g. Sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate. The simplest hydride, hydride or alane, remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH3)n, in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride with the formula (BH3)2.

 Oxidation states +1 and 2+ 
Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al3+ centres, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al3+ species.

 Aluminium(I) 
AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the tri-halide is heated with aluminium. The composition AlI is unstable at room temperature with respect to the triiodide:(
: 3 AlI   AlI3  +  2 Al
A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine, Al4I4(NEt3)4. Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al2O and Al2S is made by heating the normal oxide, Al2O3, with silicon at  in a vacuum.() Such materials quickly disproportionates to the starting materials.

 Aluminium(II) 
Very simple Al(II) compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of Al metal with oxidants. For example, monoxide, AlO, has been detected in the gas phase after explosion() and in stellar absorption spectra.()  More thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula R4Al2 where R is a large organic ligand.(Werner Uhl, Organoelement Compounds Possessing Al---Al, Ga---Ga, In---In, and Tl---Tl Single Bonds Advances in Organometallic Chemistry Volume 51, 2004, Pages 53-108. )

 Analysis 
The presence of aluminium can be detected in qualitative analysis using aluminon.

 Applications 
 General use 
Aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal.() Global production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes. It exceeded that of any other metal except iron (837.5 million tonnes).() Forecast for 2012 is 4245 million tons, driven by rising Chinese output.(Rising Chinese Costs to Support Aluminum Prices Bloomberg News, November 23, 2009) 

Aluminium is almost always alloyed, which markedly improves its mechanical properties, especially when tempered. For example, the common foils and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium.() The main alloying agents are copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and silicon (e.g., duralumin) and the levels of these other metals are in the range of a few percent by weight.(J. Paul Lyle, Douglas A. Granger, Robert E. Sanders, Aluminum Alloys Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )

Some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in:
* Transportation (automobiles, aircraft, trucks, cars, marine vessels, bicycles, etc.) as sheet, tube, castings, etc.
* Packaging (cans, foil, etc.)
* Construction (windows, doors, siding, building wire, etc.)
* A wide range of household items, from utensils to bats, watches.()
* Street lighting poles, sailing ship masts, poles, etc.
* Outer shells of consumer electronics, also cases for equipment e.g. photographic equipment.
* transmission lines for power distribution
* steel and Alnico magnets
* Super purity aluminium (SPA, 99.980% to 99.999% Al), used in electronics and CDs.
* sinks for electronic appliances such as transistors and CPUs.
* Substrate material of copper clad laminates used in high brightness lighting.
* Powdered aluminium is used in paint, and in pyrotechnics such as rocket fuels and thermite.
* Aluminium can be reacted with hydrochloric acid or with hydroxide to produce hydrogen gas.
* A variety of countries, including France, Italy, Poland, Finland, Romania, Israel, and the former Yugoslavia, have issued coins struck in aluminium or aluminium-copper alloys.(Worlds coinage uses 24 chemical elements, 2 part series, World Coin News (February 17, 1992 and March 2, 1992))
* Some guitar models sports aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments, usually either chrome or black. Guitars and Bean are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium, which gives the instrument a very distinct sound.
* Sustainability of Aluminium in Buildings

Relatively pure aluminium is rarely encountered -  only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness. A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by vapour deposition or (very infrequently) vapour deposition or other chemical means to form coatings and mirrors.

 Aluminium compounds 
Because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivative exhibit low toxicity, the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications.

 Alumina 

oxide (Al2O3) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale. The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium. About 10% of the production capacity is used for other applications. A major use is as an absorbent, for example alumina will remove water from hydrocarbons, to enable subsequent processes that are poisoned by moisture. Aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes, e.g. the process for converting sulfide to sulfur in refineries and for the alkylation of amines. Many industrial catalysts are supported, meaning generally that an expensive catalyst (e.g., platinum) is dispersed over a high surface area material such as alumina. Being a very hard material (hardness 9), alumina is widely used as an abrasive and the production of applications that exploit its inertness, e.g., in pressure sodium lamps.

 Sulfates 
Several sulfates of aluminium find applications.  sulfate (Al2(SO4)3(H2O)18) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms. About half of the production is consumed in treatment. The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a mordant, in extinguisher, as a food additive, in fireproofing, and in leather tanning. Aluminium ammonium sulfate (Al(NH4)(SO4)2)(H2O)12, also called alum, is used as a mordant and in leather tanning.(Otto Helmboldt, L. Keith Hudson, Chanakya Misra, Karl Wefers, Wolfgang Heck, Hans Stark, Max Danner, Norbert Rsch Aluminum Compounds, Inorganic in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )  Aluminium potassium sulfate (Al(K)(SO4)2)(H2O)12 is used similarly. The consumption of both alums is declining.

 Chlorides 
chloride (AlCl3) is used in petroleum refining and in the production of synthetic rubber and polymers.
Although it has a similar name, chlorohydrate has fewer and very different applications, e.g. as an hardening agent and an antiperspirant. It is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal.

 Niche compounds 
Given the scale of aluminium compounds, a small scale application could still involve thousands of tons. One of the many compounds used at this intermediate level include acetate, a salt used in solution as an astringent.  borate (Al2O3 B2O3) is used in the production of glass and ceramics.  fluorosilicate (Al2(SiF6)3) is used in the production of synthetic gemstones, glass and ceramic. phosphate (AlPO4) is used in the manufacture: of glass and ceramic, pulp and paper products, cosmetics, paints and varnishes and in making dental cement.  hydroxide (Al(OH)3) is used as an antacid, as a mordant, in water purification, in the manufacture of glass and ceramic and in the waterproofing of fabrics. aluminium hydride is a powerful reducing agent used in chemistry. Organoaluminiums are used as acids and cocatalysts. For example, methylaluminoxane is a cocatalyst for Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization to produce polymers such as polyethene.



 Aluminium alloys in structural applications 
File:Aluminium foam.jpg|thumb|foam

Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system (ANSI) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents (DIN and ISO).

The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation.

One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined limit, meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. This implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a fixed life rather than an infinite life.

Another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat.
Workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Forming operations where a torch is used therefore require some expertise, since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting. The problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low point, which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual coolingin effect annealing the stresses.

The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry; even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500 K. The Agena upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region.

Another alloy of some value is bronze (CuAl5).

 History 
File:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of the Anteros (commonly mistaken for either The Angel of Christian Charity or Eros) in Circus, London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium.

Ancient Greeks and Romans used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds; alum is still used as a styptic. In 1761, de Morveau suggested calling the base alum alumine. In 1808, Davy identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first termed alumium and later aluminum (see etymology section, below).

The metal was first produced in 1825 (in an impure form) by Danish physicist and chemist Christian rsted. He reacted anhydrous chloride with potassium amalgam and yielded a lump of metal looking similar to tin.()
Whler was aware of these experiments and cited them, but after redoing the experiments of rsted he concluded that this metal was pure potassium. He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and yielded aluminium.( Whler is generally credited with isolating aluminium (Latin alumen, alum), but also rsted can be listed as its discoverer.() Further, Berthier discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it.() Frenchman Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville improved Whlers method in 1846, and described his improvements in a book in 1859, chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium.(Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville De laluminium, ses proprits, sa fabrication (Paris, 1859)) Deville likely also conceived the idea of the electrolysis of aluminium oxide dissolved in cryolite; Martin Hall and Paul Hroult might have developed the more practical process after Deville.

Before the process was developed in the late 1880s, aluminium was exceedingly difficult to extract from its various ores. This made pure aluminium more valuable than gold.() Bars of aluminium were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1855.() Napoleon III, Emperor of France, is reputed to have given a banquet where the most honoured guests were given aluminium utensils, while the others made do with gold.()(ChemMatters October 1990 p. 14.)

Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the 100 ounce (2.8 kg) capstone of the Monument in 1884, a time when one ounce (30 grams) cost the daily wage of a common worker on the project;() The capstone, which was set in place on December 6, 1884, in an elaborate dedication ceremony, was the largest single piece of aluminium cast at the time, when aluminium was as expensive as silver.()

The Cowles companies supplied aluminium alloy in quantity in the States and England using smelters like the furnace of Wilhelm Siemens by 1886.( and  and ) Martin Hall of Ohio in the U.S. and Hroult of France independently developed the Hall-Hroult electrolytic process that made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper and is now the principal method used worldwide. Halls process,() in 1888 with the financial backing of E. Hunt, started the Pittsburgh Reduction Company today known as Alcoa. Hroults process was in production by 1889 in Switzerland at Aluminium Industrie, now Alcan, and at Aluminium, now Group and Alcoa, by 1896 in Scotland.()

By 1895, the metal was being used as a building material as far away as Sydney, Australia in the dome of the Chief Secretarys Building.

Many navies have used an aluminium superstructure for their vessels; the 1975 fire aboard USS Belknap that gutted her aluminium superstructure, as well as observation of battle damage to British ships during the War, led to many navies switching to all steel superstructures. The Arleigh Burke class was the first such U.S. ship, being constructed entirely of steel.

wire was once widely used for domestic electrical wiring. Owing to corrosion-induced failures, a number of fires resulted. This discontinuation thus illustrates one failed application of the otherwise highly useful metal.

In 2008, the price of aluminium peaked at $1.45/lb in July but dropped to $0.70/lb by December.(Aluminum prices.)

 Etymology 
Two variants of the metals name are in current use, aluminium and aluminum (besides the obsolete alumium).
The Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but, three years later, recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both.(IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements.) IUPAC prefers the use of aluminium in its internal publications, although nearly as many IUPAC publications use the spelling aluminum.(IUPAC Web site publication search for aluminum.)

Most countries use the spelling aluminium. In the United States, the spelling aluminum predominates.((Bremner, John Words on Words: A Dictionary for Writers and Others Who Care about Words, pp. 2223. ISBN 0-231-04493-3.) The Oxford Dictionary prefers aluminum, whereas the Australian Dictionary prefers aluminium. In 1926, the Chemical Society officially decided to use aluminum in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling aluminium as a British variant.

The name aluminium derives from its status as a base of alum. It is borrowed from French; its ultimate source, alumen, in turn is a Latin word that literally means bitter salt.()

The earliest citation given in the English Dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium, which British chemist and inventor Davy employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral alumina. The citation is from the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London: Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium.(alumium, Oxford English Dictionary. Ed. J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, second edition Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. Accessed 29 October 2006. Citation is listed as 1808 SIR H. DAVY in Phil. Trans. XCVIII. 353. The ellipsis in the quotation is as it appears in the OED citation.)()

Davy settled on aluminum by the time he published his 1812 book Chemical Philosophy: This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina.() But the same year, an anonymous contributor to the Review, a British political-literary journal, in a review of Davys book, objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium, for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound.()

The -ium suffix conformed to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, -um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time, as for example platinum, known to Europeans since the century, molybdenum, discovered in 1778, and tantalum, discovered in 1802. The -um suffix is consistent with the universal spelling alumina for the oxide, as lanthana is the oxide of lanthanum, and magnesia, ceria, and thoria are the oxides of magnesium, cerium, and thorium respectively.

The spelling used throughout the 19th century by most U.S. chemists was aluminium, but common usage is less clear.(, In the USA, the position was more complicated. Noah Websters Dictionary of 1828 has only aluminum, though the standard spelling among US chemists throughout most of the nineteenth century was aluminium; it was the preferred version in The Century Dictionary of 1889 and is the only spelling given in the Webster Unabridged Dictionary of 1913.) The aluminum spelling is used in the Dictionary of 1828. In his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal 1892, Charles Martin Hall used the -um spelling, despite his constant use of the -ium spelling in all the patents( he filed between 1886 and 1903.() It has consequently been suggested that the spelling reflects an easier to pronounce word with one fewer syllable, or that the spelling on the flier was a mistake. Halls domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling aluminum became the standard in North America; the Webster Unabridged Dictionary of 1913, though, continued to use the -ium version.

 Health concerns 




Despite its natural abundance, aluminium has no known function in biology. It is remarkably nontoxic, aluminium sulfate having an LD50 of 6207 mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500 grams for a 80 kg person.( Despite the extremely low acute toxicity, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce. 

Some toxicity can be traced to deposition in bone and the central nervous system, which is particularly increased in patients with reduced renal function. Because aluminium competes with calcium for absorption, increased amounts of dietary aluminium may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation. In very high doses, aluminium can cause neurotoxicity, and is associated with altered function of the barrier.() A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience dermatitis, digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as deodorants or antacids. In those without allergies, aluminium is not as toxic as metals, but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts.() Although the use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general, excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels. Studies have shown that consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium significantly increases aluminium absorption,() and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nervous and osseus tissue.() Furthermore, aluminium increases estrogen-related expression in human cancer cells cultured in the laboratory.() The estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as a metalloestrogen.

The effects of aluminium in antiperspirants has been examined over the course of decades with little evidence of skin irritation.( Nonetheless, its occurrence in antiperspirants, dyes (such as aluminium lake), and food additives is controversial in some quarters. Although there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adults,(Gitelman, H. J. Physiology of Aluminum in Man, in Aluminum and Health, CRC Press, 1988, ISBN 0824780264, p. 90) some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal.() Aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water.() Some researchers have expressed concerns that the aluminium in antiperspirants may increase the risk of breast cancer,() and aluminium has controversially been implicated as a factor in disease.() The water pollution incident involved a number of people consuming sulfate. Investigations of the long-term health effects are still ongoing, but elevated brain aluminium concentrations have been found in post-mortem examinations of victims, and further research to determine if there is a link with amyloid angiopathy has been commissioned.()

According to Alzheimers Society, the overwhelming medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship between aluminium and Alzheimers disease.(Aluminium and Alzheimers disease, The Alzheimers Society. Retrieved 30 January 2009.) Nevertheless, some studies, such as those on the cohort,() cite aluminium exposure as a risk factor for disease. Some brain plaques have been found to contain increased levels of the metal.() Research in this area has been inconclusive; aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the disease rather than a causal agent. In any event, if there is any toxicity of aluminium, it must be via a very specific mechanism, since total human exposure to the element in the form of naturally occurring clay in soil and dust is enormously large over a lifetime.()() Scientific consensus does not yet exist about whether aluminium exposure could directly increase the risk of Alzheimers disease.(

 Effect on plants 

Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acid soils. Although it is generally harmless to plant growth in pH-neutral soils, the concentration in acid soils of toxic Al3+ cations increases and disturbs root growth and function.()()()()

Most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than ions. The acidity of the soil is therefore a result of hydrolysis of aluminium compounds.() This concept of corrected lime potential() to define the degree of base saturation in soils became the basis for procedures now used in testing laboratories to determine the lime requirement() of soils.(Applying lime to soils reduces the Aluminum toxicity to plants.
 
)

Wheats adaptation to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of compounds that bind to the harmful aluminium cations. Sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat. It was shown that sorghums aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene, as for wheat.() This is not the case in all plants.

<eecs485_article_body>spelling 

Azerbaijan is an economy that has completed its post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy (with the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline), from one where the state played the major role. Azeri GDP grew 41.7% in the first quarter of 2007, possibly the highest of any nation worldwide.()
Such rates cannot be sustained, but despite reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest GDP growth in the world in 2005 only to Guinea), and 2006 over 34.6% (world highest), in 2008 dropped to 10.8%, and dropped further to 9.3% in 2009 (Today.az GDP growth makes 3.4% in Azerbaijan in 2009).  The real GDP growth rate for 2011 is expected at 3.7%(Indexmundi Azerbaijan GDP - real growth rate).

Large oil reserves are a major contributor to the economy. The national currency, the manat, was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.

Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind macroeconomic stabilization. The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms. The government has largely completed privatization of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the economic activity in the country is regulated by the Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic.

Macro-economic trend
The following is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Azerbaijan at market prices(estimated by the International Monetary Fund) with figures in millions of Manats.


For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar was exchanged at 1,565.88 Manats only. Currently, the new Manat is in use, with an exchange rate of about 1 manat  $1.10. Mean graduate pay was $5.76 per manhour in 2010.

For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been petroleum, which represented 10 percent of Azerbaijans GDP in 2005, and is projected to double to almost 20 percent of GDP in 2007.(Azerbaijan: Energy profile (Enerpub, 13 December 2007)) Now that Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the Soviets because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven reserves in the Caspian Basin, which Azerbaijan shares with Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkmenistan, are comparable in size to the North Sea, although exploration is still in the early stages.

External trade
thumb|right|200px|Azerbaijani exports in 2006
Azerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with various oil companies. An export pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from Baku through Tbilisi, Georgia to Ceyhan, Turkey (the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) became operational in 2006. The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in revenues for the country over the next 30 years. The recent high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijans economy as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom. Eastern Caspian producers in cara was here Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their production. In March 2001, Azerbaijan concluded a gas agreement with Turkey, providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.

In 2002 the Azerbaijani marine had 54 ships.()

Overview
right|200px|thumb|Downtown Baku.
right|200px|thumb|The National Bank.
Through the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been more developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less diversified, as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector. With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in early 1990s until nowadays.

Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijans economy with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijans oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by BP. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d. People visit petroleum spas (or oil spas) to bathe in the local crude in Naftalan(Azerbaijani answer to oil glut: Bathe in it - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune) A leading caviar producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijans industry today is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga in the Sea.

Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a economy, but its energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building up with Turkey, Iran, UAE, and the countries of EU. Azerbaijan is also a member of the Cooperation Organization (ECO). Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices and the location of new pipelines in the region.
In 2010, Azerbaijan entered into top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU countries with  9.46 billion.(http://today.az/news/business/82397.html)

Environmental issues
Azerbaijan faces serious environmental challenges. Soil throughout the region was contaminated by DDT and toxic defoliants used in cotton production during the Soviet era. Caspian petroleum and petrochemicals industries also have contributed to present air and water pollution problems. Several environmental organizations exist in Azerbaijan, yet few funds have been allocated to begin the necessary cleanup and prevention programs. Over-fishing by poachers is threatening the survival of Caspian sturgeon stocks, the source of most of the worlds supply of caviar. The on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) has listed as threatened all sturgeon species, including all commercial Caspian varieties. In 2007 the Blacksmith Institute listed Sumgayit as one of the ten most polluted cities in the world.(Walsh, Bryan (2007) The Worlds Most Polluted Places Time Magazine, accessed 21 June 2010)(Staff (14 September 2007) Ten most polluted places named BBC News)  According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting 2007 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey, the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, was the worlds lowest-ranking city for health and sanitation;(Go Figure: Mercer issues 2007 Worldwide Quality of Living Survey Mercer Human Resource Consulting) however, by 2010 Baku had pulled itself up 4 index points and its place was taken by Port-au-Prince in Haiti.(Pesquisa Mercer 2010: classificao mundial de Qualidade de Vida nas cidades Mercer Human Resource Consulting, in Portuguese, accessed 21 June 2010)

Diversification
Image:Baku pipelines.svg|thumb|right|200px|The pipeline (green) is one of several pipelines running from Baku.
In 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 per cent of the Azerbaijani economy. Diversification of the economy into manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.

Nagorno-Karabakh/Armenia

Armenia supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government;

Nagorno-Karabakh is a region within Azerbaijan. The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Azeris in Armenia and ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan. In 1990, after violent episodes in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Baku and Sumgait, Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and forcibly occupied Baku, killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian paramilitaries operating in Karabakh. Moscow also deployed troops to Yerevan. Following the collapse of the Union, conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was heavily influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring nations in order to keep both under control.

More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1992 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized Shusha and Lachin (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in occupying almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the Security Council adopted four resolutions calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when Russia brokered a cease-fire.

Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the OSCE. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by Russia, France, and the States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, sniper-fire, and landmine incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.

Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in West, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Powell launched the talks on April 3, 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia, and France until April 6, 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.

The two countries are still technically at war.

Caspian Sea boundaries are not yet determined with Iran and Turkmenistan. Issues with Russia and Kazakhstan were settled in 2003.

Armenia is the second most densely populated of the former Soviet republics. It is situated between the Sea and the Sea, bordered on the north and east by Georgia and Azerbaijan and on the south and west by Iran and Turkey.

According to Forbes magazine Armenia had the second second worst economy in the world in 2011.()()() 



Until independence, Armenias economy was based largely on industrychemicals, electronic products, machinery, food, rubber and textiles; it was highly dependent on outside resources. Agriculture accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold and lead. The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant) from Russia; the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.

Like other former States, Armenias economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the 1988 earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenias dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. In 1992-93, GDP fell nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.

Nevertheless, the of Armenia, helped by the cease-fire that has been in effect in Nagorno-Karabakh since 1994, has been able to carry out wideranging economic reforms which paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors such as agriculture in the economy.

This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The IMF, Bank, EBRD, as well as other IFIs and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed $800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the zone.

Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improve the investment climate, and accelerate the privatization process. A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a Law on Privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization. The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenias unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002. Armenias severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector. The government made some improvements in tax and customs administration in 2005, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement. Investment in the construction and industrial sectors is expected to continue in 2006 and will help to ensure annual average real GDP growth of about 13.9%.

Overview
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.

History of the modern Armenian economy
Armenia emerged from the umbra of the former Union in 1991 and migrated from a planned economy (Communist system) to a economy (capitalist system). Both the nation and the economy are nascent. Regional conflict retards growth. In addition, the border with Turkey is closed, making access to sea ports difficult and transportation logistics challenging to a country largely dependent upon imports. In 2003, Armenia became a member of the WTO (Trade Organization). The nation is making substantial progress in privatizing ownership of what used to be State Owned industries under the former Soviet system. Despite marked progress, Armenia still suffers from a large trade imballance and is still largely dependent upon foreign aid and remittances from Armenian nationals working abroad, and members of the diaspora donating aid through NGOs (non-governmental organizations) such as the church. There are some foreign capital inflows, but no robust foreign investment. Despite progress since the Soviet era, the unemployment rate still hovers near 30% and there remains a huge gulf between actual and potential Domestic Product.

Global competitiveness
The Armenian economys competitiveness is low and stagnating according to the Competitiveness Index, in which Armenias ranking slipped from 80th out of 132 countries in 2006-2007 index to 93rd out of 131 countries in the 2007-2008 index (just below Libya, Namibia, Georgia, Serbia and Pakistan).(2007-2008 Global Competitiveness Index rankings and 20062007 comparisons, World Economic Forum.)

Domestic business environment
thumb|The notoriously corrupt Armenian State Revenue Committee (housing both the Armenian Customs Service and the Armenian Tax Service) helps maintain import monopolies as well as aid tax evasion.

Armenias economy is highly anticompetitive with government-connected individuals enjoying de facto monopolies over the import and distribution of basic commodities and foodstuffs, and under-reporting revenue to avoid paying taxes.

Despite pronouncements at the highest levels of government on the importance of free competition, Armenia is next to last in the effectiveness of its anti-monopoly policy according to the 2010 results of the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.()

According to Nercissiantz, President Sarkisians chief economic adviser, Businessmen holding state positions have turned into oligarchs who have avoided paying sufficient taxes by abusing their state positions, distorted markets with unequal conditions, breached the rules of competition, impeded or prevented small and medium-sized business entry into manufacturing and thereby sharply deepened social polarization in the republic.(Press Review, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), February 26, 2009.)

Following the advice of economic advisors who cautioned Armenias leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition. Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.(Competitive Edge: The pitfalls of monopolies, and the challenges of a business-influenced parliament, ArmeniaNow.com, January 4, 2008.)

Monopolies
According to one analyst, Armenias economic system is anticompetitive due to the structure of the economy being a type of monopoly or oligopoly. The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market.(Price Predictions: With present inflation at nearly triple expectation, economists challenge 2009 forecast, ArmeniaNow.com, November 14, 2008.)

According to the estimate of a former prime minister, Bagratian, 55 percent of Armenias GDP is controlled by 44 families.(

In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having dominant positions in Armenia.(

In October 2009, when visiting Yerevan, the World Banks managing director, Okonjo-Iweala, warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the oligopolistic structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows zero tolerance towards corruption.(Armenia Warned To End Oligopoly, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL)October 10, 2009.) I think you can only go so far with this economic model, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told a news conference in Yerevan. Armenia is a lower middle-income country. If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure. That is clear. She also called for a sweeping reform of tax and customs administration, the creation of a strong and independent judicial system as well as a tough fight against government corruption.( The warning was echoed by the Monetary Fund.(Armenia Learning From Crisis, Says World Bank , Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), November 27, 2009.)

GDP
The Domestic Product of Armenia stood at 8.8 billion dollars in 2010; with a population of 3.2 million, this amounts to a per capita of $2,676 (power parity $5,178).(  GDP growth for 2010 was at 2.9 percent, and inflation was at 8 percent.(

GDP growth is expected to be around 3 percent in 2011, with inflation returning to 4-5 percent.(

In comparison, in 2006, the GDP was estimated to be 6.6 billion USD  per calendar year and the GDP per capita  (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $5,400 US. The growth rate was high at 13.4%, but the relatively low base must be considered. Low inflation was maintained around 2.6% annually.(https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html)

Growth
After a decade of double-digit growth, Armenias economy declined by 14.4 percent in 2009.(  The year-to-date growth as of October 2010 was 2.8 percent.( In 2010, the main macro deficiencies of the Armenian economy  namely, unsustainable growth drivers, a narrow and resource-dominated export base, and overdependence on private transfers  were still prevalent.( 

According to official figures, Armenias economy grew by 13.8 percent in 2007.(ARMENIA: GAS PRICE HIKE POSES CHALLENGE FOR GOVERNMENT, EurasiaNet, April 24, 2008.) According to research funded by the USAID CAPS project, Armenias exceptionally high rate of economic growth during the last decade has been largely dependent on external factors (e.g. remittances, assistance from international financial and donor organization). Furthermore, the study concluded that despite its record growth on most macro-economic metrics, Armenia is low and lagging in competitiveness.(2008 National Competitiveness Report of Armenia, Economy and Values Research Center, 2008.)

According to the Statistical Service, the booming construction and service sectors remain the driving forces of the high growth rate of GDP.(Armenian Growth Still In Double Digits, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), September 20, 2007.)

Cash remittances
Cash remittances sent back home from Armenians working abroadmostly in Russia and the United Statesare growing and contribute significantly to Armenias Gross Domestic Product (between 15 to 30 percent). They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.

According to the Bank of Armenia, during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled $668.6 million USD, equivalent to 15 percent of the countrys first-half Gross Domestic Product.(Cash Transfers To Armenia Jump To New High, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), August 5, 2008.) However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks. According to RFE/RL, comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenias GDP in the first half of 2008.(

In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of $1.32 billion USD.( According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the countrys 2005 Gross Domestic Product.(Survey Highlights Armenias Lingering Unemployment, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), February 9, 2006.)

Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010. Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.(

Construction sector
Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s.  According to the National Statistical Service, Armenias booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenias GDP during the first eight months of 2007.( According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenias economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.(

However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the Foundation is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets.( This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.(

Retail trade
In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.(  The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth. The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.(

Services sector
In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the sector was the driving force behind Armenias recent high economic growth rate.(  In 2010, the volume of services increased as much as 7.4 percent from January to September, over the same period in 2009.(

Tourism

According to official data, in 2007, a record-high 500,000 tourists visited Armenia  most of them ethnic Armenians from Europe, Russia and the United States.(Armenia To Cut Visa Fees In Bid To Boost Tourism, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), October 17, 2008.) 2010 saw a noticeable increase in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Armenia  estimated to be 80,000.(

However, according to private tour operators and other individuals familiar with the countrys tourism industry, government claims that hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Armenia each year are wide of the mark.()  Official statistics show that as many 575,000 tourists visited Armenia from abroad in 2009; the government stated earlier in 2010 that the figure will surpass 620,000 in 2010.(  However, data from the National Statistical Service shows that there were only 65,000  foreigners staying in Armenian hotels in 2009.  Ara Vartanian, the chairman of the Armenian Trade and Industry Chamber, thinks that this measure is a far more objective indicator of the tourist influx into the country.(

Industrial sector
Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.( According to the National Statistical Service, during the JanuaryAugust 2007 period, Armenias sector was the single largest contributor to the countrys GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year.( In 2005, Armenias industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.(Government Downplays Economic Cost Of Russian Gas Price Hike, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), February 10, 2006.)

Mining

40 percent of Armenias exports in 2009 were mining exports.(

Agricultural sector

As of 2010, the agricultural production comprises on average 25 percent of Armenias GDP.( In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenias GDP.(Kocharian Orders Tax Exemption For Armenian Farmers, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), August 8, 2006.)
    
Armenias agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of JanuarySeptember 2010.  This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased agricultural subsidies by the Armenian government (per WTO requirements).(

Foreign aid
United States
The government receives aid from the government of the States through the States Agency for International Development and the Challenge Corporation.

On March 27, 2006, the Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia. The single stated goal of the Armenian Compact is the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector. The Compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenias proposed Lifeline road network. The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.(Armenia and Millennium Challenge Corporation: Building a Dynamic Partnership for Poverty Reduction through Economic Growth, Millennium Challenge Corporation, March 27, 2006.)

In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued. The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenias poor governance record. Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction. Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.(

European Union
With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenias chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence. From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least 157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.(

External trade
Exports
In 2010, Armenias exports remained resource-dependent, largely because the non-resource-intensive sectors were significantly less competitive. Armenia has not succeeded in increasing and diversifying exports beyond raw materials thus leaving room for a greater vulnerability to external shocks.( There was a 43.9 percent increase in overall exports during the January to September period. The main three export destinations were Bulgaria with 15.2 percent of total exports, followed by Germany with 14.2 percent and Russia with 13.9 percent. Raw minerals were the main export sent to Bulgaria and Germany.(

Imports
The global economic crisis has had less impact on imports because the sector is more diversified than exports. In the first nine months of 2010, imports grew about 19 percent, just about equal to the decline of the same sector in 2009.(

Deficit
During the first half of 2008, Armenias widening current-account deficit grew by 66 percent to $1.39 billion USD, with a 40 percent rise in imports. Furthermore, Armenian exports fell by about one percent to $520 million USD.(

According to the National Statistical Service, Armenias trade deficit in 2006 was $1.2 billion with growth in exports being largely flat.(Armenia Keeps Up Robust Growth, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), March 30, 2007.) During the first 11 months of 2006, net imports grew by 21 percent to $1.95 billion, while exports stood at $895 million, up 0.3 percent from the same period in 2005.(Armenia Posts Record-High Trade Deficit, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), January 8, 2007.)

Partners
European Union
In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenias foreign trade.( Germany is Armenias largest trading partner among EU member states, accounting for 7.2 percent of trade; this is due largely to mining exports. Armenian exports to EU countries have skyrocketed by 65.9 percent, making up more than half of all 2010 January to September exports. Imports from EU countries increased by 17.1 percent, constituting 22.5 percent of all imports.(

During JanuaryFebruary 2007, Armenias trade with the Union totaled $200 million.( During the first 11 months of 2006, the European Union remained Armenias largest trading partner, accounting for 34.4 percent of its $2.85 billion commercial exchange during the 11-month period.(

Russia and former Soviet republics
Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010  on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.(

During JanuaryFebruary 2007, Armenias trade with Russia and other Soviet republics was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the countrys number one trading partner.( During the first 11 months of 2006, the volume of Armenias trade with Russia was $376.8 million or 13.2 percent of the total commercial exchange.(

China
As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenias foreign trade.(Chinese FM Visits Armenia, Urges Closer Ties, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), February 17, 2011.) The volume of Chinese-Armenian trade soared by 55 percent to $390 million in JanuaryNovember 2010. Armenian exports to China, though still modest in absolute terms, nearly doubled in that period.(

Iran
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Iran was $200 million - which is approximately equal to the trade between Armenia and Turkey.(  The number of Iranian tourists has risen in recent years, with an estimated 80,000 Iranian tourists in 2010.(

Turkey
In 2010, the volume of bilateral trade with Turkey was about $200 million, with trade taking place without open borders, across Georgian territory.(  This figure is not expected to increase significantly so long as the land border between the Armenia and Turkey remains closed.(

United States
From JanuarySeptember 2010, bilateral trade with the United States measured approximately $150 million, on track for about a 30 percent increase over 2009.( An increase in Armenias exports to the US in 2009 and 2010 has been due to shipments of aluminum foil.(

During the first 11 months of 2006, U.S.-Armenian trade totaled $152.6 million.(

Georgia
The volume of Georgian-Armenian trade remains modest in both relative and absolute terms. According to official Armenian statistics, it rose by 11 percent to $91.6 million in JanuaryNovember 2010. The figure was equivalent to just over 2 percent of Armenias overall foreign trade.(Armenia, Georgia Agree On Joint Border Control, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), February 16, 2011.)

Foreign debt
Armenias national debt has increased significantly since 2008 when public external debt consisted of only 13.5 percent of GDP.(   By the end of 2010, Armenias external debt is projected to form about 42 percent of GDP, and 50 percent in 2012.(

As of late November 2009, the Armenian governments debt was around $3 billion USD, having doubled in size over the course of the previous year.( With the Armenian government needing more anti-crisis loans from the World Bank and other foreign donors, the ratio is expected to exceed 40 percent in 2010.( According to a World Bank official, a country that has around 12 percent rate of growth or even lower, at the range of 7 to 8 percent, can afford a level of debt of up to 50 percent. The official warned that the debt servicing payments of the Armenian government will surge by 2013 and absorb quite significant part of tax revenues.(

According to another estimate, the ratio between the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the states foreign debt has reached 46 percent.(Change Needed in Distribution of Foreign Credits: Union chair says economic indexes disturbing, ArmeniaNow.com, November 27, 2009.) Economists generally agree that a country is insolvent, if its foreign debt surpasses 50 percent of its GDP.( Critics of the government say that the $500 million credit from Russia should have gone to develop industry, instead of going to the construction sector.(

Transportation routes and Energy lines
Internal
Since early 2008, Armenias entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway.(Armenia Pressing Ahead With Iran Rail Link, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL, October 14, 2008.)(Armenia Scrambles To Restore Vital Supplies Via Georgia, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), August 18, 2008.)

Through Georgia
Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.

The only operational rail link into Armenia is from Georgia. During Soviet times, Armenias rail network connected to Russias via Georgia through Abkhazia along the Sea. However, the rail link between Abkhazia and Georgia proper has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.(

The Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia. The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports. Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.(

Armenias main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at ) is along the river near the Armenian town of Bagratashen and the Georgian town of Sadakhlo.

The Upper Lars border crossing (at Gorge) between Georgia and Russia across the Mountains served as Armenias sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe.(Russia, Georgia Agree To Reopen Border Gate, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), December 24, 2009.) It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal.( Upper Lars is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgias Russian-backed breakaway regions of Ossetia and Abkhazia. The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic.( This crossing is expected to reopen starting on March 1, 2010.(

Through Turkey and Azerbaijan
An economic blockade with Turkey and Azerbaijan has cut Armenias rail link between Gyumri and Kars to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan. Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan. Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.

In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.(

Through Iran
A new gas pipeline to Iran has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of Meghri allows trade with that country.  An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.

As of October 2008, the Armenian government is considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran.( The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenias mountainous southern province of Syunik which borders Iran. Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenias 2008 state budget).(  As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch .(  In June 2010, Transport Minister Manuk Vartanian revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railways construction.(

Labor


Monthly wages
According to the state-owned Armenpress news agency, the average monthly wage in Armenia for the first half of 2007 was 70,700 drams (about $210 USD).(Average Wage In Armenia Rises To $210, ARMENPRESS, August 3, 2007.)

As of April 24, 2008, the average monthly salary is 75,000 drams (about $242 US dollars).( According to the ROA National Statistical Service, the average monthly salary during January - June 2008 is 86,850 drams (about $287 at the time). About 62% of officially registered wage earners earn at least the average monthly wage, while only 19.6% receive a monthly salary of over 100,000 drams (about $330 at the time).(Mortgage Loans Beyond the Reach of the Middle Class, Hetq Online, July 28, 2008.)

Unemployment
According to research commissioned by the Yerevan office of the for Security and Cooperation in Europe, at least one in three working-age Armenians was unemployed as of February 2005 despite several consecutive years of double-digit economic growth. The finding sharply contrasts with governments official unemployment rate of about 10 percent.( A 2003 household survey conducted by the National Statistical Survey found that the real unemployment rate is about 33 percent.(

Migrant workers
Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenias residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work. Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration. OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005. According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.(

According to an OSCE survey, a typical Armenian worker is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33.(

In 2010, the value of the Armenian Dram (AMD) was artificially kept high during the height of the global economic crisis. Had the AMD been allowed to depreciate to its market level, exports would have become more competitive and the purchasing power of the majority of the population who are dependent on remittances from abroad would have increased. Instead, the value of the AMD was kept high, out of a fear of inflation and concern about alienating the powerful government-connected importers of oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes and beverages.(

The AMD/USD exchange rate depreciated by 6.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, before it began to show the expected end-of-the-year appreciation. In comparison between the January to October periods of 2010 and 2009, depreciation stands at 4.7 percent.(

Government revenue and taxation
The Armenian government collected 383.5 billion drams ($1.26 billion) in various taxes in the first nine months of 2008 (a 33.2 percent increase from the same period last year).(Government Keeps Up Strong Growth In Tax Revenues, Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), October 14, 2008.)
     
Many large companies have a privileged status when it comes to taxation.  Big business is not taxed in proportion to its capacity and output, and the disproportionate burden falls on small and medium size businesses.(

New VAT tax
Over half of the tax revenues in the JanuaryAugust 2008 time period were generated from value-added taxes (tax). By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues.( This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenias double-digit economic growth in recent years).(

Tax evasion
Many Armenian companies, especially those owned by government-connected tycoons, have long reported suspiciously low earnings, thereby avoiding paying larger taxes.(

Environmental issues
Armenia is trying to address its environmental problems. It has established a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal, with the resulting revenues used for environmental protection activities. Armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a group of 12 former Soviet republics) and with members of the international community on environmental issues. The Armenian Government is working toward closing the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as soon as alternate energy sources can be identified.

Energy


Banking
Armenias financial system is not integrated into the global network. According to the head of the Armenian Central Banks (CBA) department for financial system policies and analyses (Vahe Vardanyan) Armenian banks have no large asset concentrations in foreign markets, particularly in capital markets. They nearly have no purchased securities (so-called securitized packages). For this reason, Armenia was virtually unaffected by the crisis of September 2008.(Untouched and Out of Touch: Armenia not affected by US crisis due to relative insignificance, ArmeniaNow, October 3, 2008.)

Armenian banking assets are very low and make up only 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).(

Takeover of Armenian industrial property by the Russian state and Russian companies
In implementing its strategy to regain political dominance over post-Soviet countries by taking over their economic infrastructure, the Russian state, since 2000, has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants. Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian governments debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets. The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official in Armenia have allowed the success of this process.(Socor, Vladimir. Armenias Energy Sector, Other Industrial Assets Passing Under Russias Control, IASPS Policy Briefings: Oil in Geostrategic Perspective, November 13, 2002.)

In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the Electricity Network (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.(

In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenias largest cement factory to the Russian ITERA gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.(Danielyan, Emil. RUSSIA TIGHTENS GRIP ON ARMENIA WITH DEBT AGREEMENTS, Eurasianet, May 7, 2003)

On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia. The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister Kasyanov and Industry Minister Klebanov, while Prime Minister Markarian and defense and security strongman Sarkisian signed for Armenia.( The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are:
* Armenias largest thermal power plant which is in the town of Hrazdan and is gas-burning

In January 2003, the Armenian government and Company RUSAL signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian governments remaining 26% share of ARMENAL aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.((RUSAL ARMENAL)

On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company Gazprom and increased Gazproms stake in the Russian-Armenian company ArmRosGazprom from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.(Socor, Vladimir. RUSSIA CEMENTS CONTROL OF ARMENIAS ENERGY SYSTEM, Eurasia Daily Monitor, November 3, 2006.) This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom. The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazproms acquisition of the electricity generating plants fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.(

In October 2008 the Russian bank Gazprombank, the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank Areximbank after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.( Gazprombank acquiert entirement la banque armnienne Areximbank)

Controversy over non-transparent deals
Critics of the Kocharian government say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts. According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian governments failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector  abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.(

Political observers say that Armenias economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian governments work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President) Sarkisian, Kocharians closest political associate. Other top government officials, including Prime Minister Markarian, had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisians frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.(

Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multimillion-dollar debts to Russia over the past decade, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western Ukraine and Georgia (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.(

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents( where an agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.( John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956,( defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.(


The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligencethe sapience of sapienscan be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine.(See the Dartmouth proposal, under Philosophy, below.) This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.( Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism,(The optimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers (see optimism in the history of AI) as well as the ideas of modern transhumanists such as Kurzweil.) but has also suffered setbacks(The setbacks referred to include the ALPAC report of 1966, the abandonment of perceptrons in 1970, the Lighthill Report of 1973 and the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987.) and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.(


AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.( Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.( General intelligence (or AI) is still among the fields long term goals.(


 History




Thinking machines and artificial beings appear in myths, such as Talos of Crete, the bronze robot of Hephaestus, and Pygmalions Galatea.( Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization: animated images were worshipped in Egypt and Greece( and humanoid automatons were built by Yan Shi, of Alexandria and Al-Jazari.( It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by ibn Hayyn, Loew and Paracelsus.( By the 19th and 20th centuries, artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction, as in Shelleys Frankenstein or apeks (Rossums Universal Robots).( McCorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge, as she describes it, to forge the gods.( Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes, fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence.


Mechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity. The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer, based on the work of mathematician Turing and others. Turings of computation suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.(This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the thesis.)( This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurology, theory and cybernetics, inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.(


The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of College in the summer of 1956.( The attendees, including John McCarthy, Minsky, Newell and Simon, became the leaders of AI research for many decades.( They and their students wrote programs that were, to most people, simply astonishing:(Russell and Norvig write it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish. ) computers were solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.( By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense( and laboratories had been established around the world.( AIs founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field: Simon predicted that machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do and Minsky agreed, writing that within a generation ... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved.(


They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.(See ) In 1974, in response to the criticism of James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI. The next few years, when funding for projects was hard to find, would later be called the winter.(


In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of systems,( a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japans generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field.( However, beginning with the collapse of the Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer lasting winter began.(



In the 1990s and early 21st century, AI achieved its greatest successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence is used for logistics, mining, diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industry.(
The success was due to several factors: the increasing computational power of computers (see law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.(

On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Kasparov.() In 2005, a Stanford robot won the Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail.(DARPA Grand Challenge  home page)
In February 2011, in a Jeopardy! show exhibition match, IBMs answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Rutter and Jennings, by a significant margin.()

The leading-edge definition of artificial intelligence research is changing over time. One pragmatic definition is: AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do cost-effectively today. For example, in 1956 character recognition (OCR) was considered AI, but today, sophisticated OCR software with a context-sensitive checker and checker software comes for free with most scanners. No one would any longer consider already-solved computing science problems like OCR artificial intelligence today.

Low-cost entertaining chess-playing software is commonly available for tablet computers. DARPA no longer provides significant funding for chess-playing computing system development. The Kinect which provides a 3D bodymotion interface for the 360 uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research,(Kinects AI breakthrough explained) but few consumers realize the technology source.

AI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of of defense R&amp;D, but are now common place consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toys.

In common usage, the term AI no longer seems to apply to off-the-shelf solved computing-science problems, which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research.


 Problems 
Can a machine act intelligently? is still an problem. Taking A machine can act intelligently as a hypothesis, many researchers have attempted to build such a machine.

The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.(

Deduction, reasoning, problem solving 

Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.( By the late 1980s and 90s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.(


For difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources  most experience a explosion: the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.(

Human beings solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.( AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of sub-symbolic problem solving: agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning; net research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skill.

Knowledge representation
right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.


representation( and engineering( are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;( situations, events, states and time;( causes and effects;( knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);( and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of what exists is an ontology (borrowing a word from traditional philosophy), of which the most general are called upper ontologies.(

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:

;reasoning and the problem: Many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions. For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969( as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.(

;The breadth of knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering  they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.( A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.

;The subsymbolic form of some knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed() or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake.() These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non-consciously and sub-symbolically.( Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI or intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.(

Planning
Image:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A control system is a form of system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.



Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.( They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or value) of the available choices.(

In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.( However, if this is not true, it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.(

planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. behavior such as this is used by algorithms and intelligence.(

Learning


learning( has been central to AI research from the beginning.(
Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper Machinery and Intelligence. ) In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: An Inductive Inference Machine.((pdf scanned copy of the original) (version published in 1957, An Inductive Inference Machine, IRE Convention Record, Section on Information Theory, Part 2, pp. 56-62))
learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. learning includes both classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression takes a set of numerical input/output examples and attempts to discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs. In learning( the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. These can be analyzed in terms of theory, using concepts like utility. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of computer science known as learning theory.(

Natural language processing
File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some grammar.


language processing( gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak. Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own, by reading the existing text available over the internet. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include retrieval (or mining) and translation.(

Motion and manipulation


The field of robotics( is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation( and navigation, with sub-problems of localization (knowing where you are), mapping (learning what is around you) and planning (figuring out how to get there).(

Perception


perception( is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. vision( is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are recognition,( facial recognition and recognition.(

Social intelligence

Emotion and social skills( play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of theory, theory, as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, for good interaction, an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions. At the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with. At best, it should have normal emotions itself.

Creativity


A sub-field of AI addresses creativity both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). A related area of computational research is Intuition and Imagination.

General intelligence


Most researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence (known as AI), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.( A few believe that anthropomorphic features like consciousness or an brain may be required for such a project.((

Many of the problems above are considered AI-complete: to solve one problem, you must solve them all. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like translation requires that the machine follow the authors argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the authors intention (social intelligence). translation, therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require AI to be done as well as humans can do it.(

 Approaches 
There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.(Nils Nilsson writes: Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about .) A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to engineering?(
Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?(
Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require sub-symbolic processing?(
John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as intelligence, a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi10.1.1.38.8384&amp;reprep1&amp;typepdfhttp://books.google.com/books?hlen&amp;lr&amp;ida_ZR81Z25z0C&amp;oifnd&amp;pgPA63&amp;dqrelated:iCpuTpmGk6gJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;otsn1-TsvqXGJ&amp;sig1xthOJ2WQmKtdSt7ISFH2yu2l3Q#vonepage&amp;q&amp;ffalsehttp://www.imagination-engines.com/

 Cybernetics and brain simulation 
is currently no consensus on how closely the brain should be simulated.

In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology, theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as Grey Walters turtles and the Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at University and the Club in England.( By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.

 Symbolic 

When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: CMU, Stanford and MIT, and each one developed its own style of research. Haugeland named these approaches to AI good old fashioned AI or GOFAI.(

; Cognitive simulation: Economist Simon and Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as science, research and science. Their research team used the results of  psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s.((

; Logic-based: Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.( His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including representation, planning and learning.( Logic was also focus of the work at the of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of programming.(

; Anti-logic or scruffy: Researchers at MIT (such as Minsky and Papert)( found that solving difficult problems in vision and language processing required ad-hoc solutions  they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Schank described their anti-logic approaches as scruffy (as opposed to the neat paradigms at CMU and Stanford).( knowledge bases (such as Lenats Cyc) are an example of scruffy AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.(

; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.( This knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of systems (introduced by Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.( The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.

 Sub-symbolic 
During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.(The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of perceptrons by Minsky and Papert in 1969. See of AI, winter, or Rosenblatt.) By the 1980s, however, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and recognition. A number of researchers began to look into sub-symbolic approaches to specific AI problems.(

; Bottom-up, embodied, situated, behavior-based or AI: Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.( Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of theory in AI. This coincided with the development of the mind thesis in the related field of science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as  movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.

; Computational Intelligence: Interest in networks and connectionism was revived by Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s.( These and other sub-symbolic approaches, such as systems and computation, are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of intelligence.(

Statistical
In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AIs recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or research). Stuart Russell and Norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats.( Critiques argue that these techniques are too focussed on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence.

 Integrating the approaches 
;Intelligent agent paradigm: An agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works  some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fieldssuch as theory and economicsthat also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.(

;architectures and architectures: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting agents in a system.( A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a intelligent system, and the study of such systems is intelligence systems integration. A control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.( Brooks architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.(


 Tools 
In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.

 Search and optimization 


Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:( Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an rule.( Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called analysis.( Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in space.( Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.

Simple exhaustive searches( are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called pruning the tree). Heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies.(

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are annealing, search and optimization.(

computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of computation include intelligence algorithms (such as ant colony or swarm optimization)( and algorithms (such as algorithms and programming).(

 Logic 


Logic( is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning( and logic programming is a method for learning.(

Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional or logic( is the logic of statements which can be true or false. logic( also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. logic,( is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. logic( models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty  1 within a distribution. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.

logics, logics and circumscription( are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: logics;( calculus, calculus and calculus (for representing events and time);( causal calculus;( belief calculus; and logics.(

Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning


Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.(

networks( are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the inference algorithm),( learning (using the algorithm),( planning (using networks)( and perception (using Bayesian networks).( Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., Markov models or filters).(

A key concept from the science of economics is utility: a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using theory, analysis,( information value theory.( These tools include models such as decision processes,( dynamic networks,( theory and design.(

 Classifiers and statistical learning methods 


The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (if shiny then diamond) and controllers (if shiny then pick up). Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.(

A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and learning approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the neural network,(
methods such as the vector machine,(
neighbor algorithm,(
mixture model,(
Bayes classifier,(
and decision tree.(
The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.(

 Neural networks 

File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the brain.

The study of neural networks( began in the decade before the field AI research was founded, in the work of Pitts and McCullough. Other important early researchers were Rosenblatt, who invented the perceptron and Werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm.(

The main categories of networks are acyclic or neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and neural networks (which allow feedback). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, perceptrons and basis networks.( Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the net, a form of attractor network, which was first described by Hopfield in 1982.( Neural networks can be applied to the problem of control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as learning and learning.(

temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex.(

 Control theory 

theory, the grandchild of cybernetics, has many important applications, especially in robotics.(

 Languages 



AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including Lisp( and Prolog.(

Evaluating progress 

In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the test. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.(

Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed matter expert Turing tests. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.(

The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are: (1) Optimal: it is not possible to perform better. (2) Strong super-human: performs better than all humans. (3) Super-human: performs better than most humans. (4) Sub-human: performs worse than most humans. For example, performance at draughts is optimal,( performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human (see chess#Computers versus humans) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.

A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from complexity and compression.( Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.

 Applications 
File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An online assistant providing customer service on a web page - one of many applications of artificial intelligence.



Artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list.  Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the effect.(

)

 Competitions and prizes 

There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, driverless cars, robot soccer and games.

 Platforms 
A platform (or platform) is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run. As Rodney Brooks(Brooks, R.A., How to build complete creatures rather than isolated cognitive simulators, in K. VanLehn (ed.), Architectures for Intelligence, pp. 225239, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ, 1991.) pointed out many years ago, it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., we need to be working out AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.

A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from systems, albeit PC-based but still an entire real-world system, to various robot platforms such as the widely available Roomba with open interface.(Hacking Roomba  Search Results  atmel)

 Philosophy 


Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness? A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below.(

;Turings polite convention: If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. Turing theorized that, ultimately, we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on its behavior. This theory forms the basis of the test.(

;The Dartmouth proposal: Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.(

; Newell and Simons physical symbol system hypothesis: A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action. Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consists of formal operations on symbols.( Dreyfus argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See critique of AI.)(
Dreyfus criticized the necessary condition of the symbol system hypothesis, which he called the psychological assumption: The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules. )(

; incompleteness theorem: A system (such as a computer program) can not prove all true statements.(This is a paraphrase of the relevant implication of Gdels theorems.) Penrose is among those who claim that Gdels theorem limits what machines can do. (See Emperors New Mind.)(

; Searles strong AI hypothesis: The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.( John Searle counters this assertion with his room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be.(

; The brain argument: The brain can be simulated. Moravec, Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.(

 Predictions 


Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both fiction and projections about the future of technology and society. The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues, and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fears.


In fiction, Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles, including
a servant (R2D2 in Wars),
a law enforcer (K.I.T.T. Knight Rider),
a comrade (Lt. Commander Data in Trek: The Next Generation),
a conqueror/overlord (Matrix),
a dictator (Folded Hands),
a benevolent provider/de facto ruler (Culture),
an assassin (Terminator),
a sentient race (Battlestar Galactica/Transformers),
an extension to human abilities (in the Shell)
and the savior of the human race (Daneel Olivaw in the Robot Series).


Shelleys Frankenstein considers a key issue in the of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern fiction, including the films I Robot, Runner and Artificial Intelligence, in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions. This issue, now known as rights, is currently being considered by, for example, Californias for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.( The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film &amp; Pray.(http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html Independent documentary Plug &amp; Pray, featuring Joseph Weizenbaum and Raymond Kurzweil)


Martin Ford, author of The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future,() and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupationsand in particular entry level jobswill be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning(Machine Learning: A Job Killer?) and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work.(


Weizenbaum wrote that AI applications can not, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as service or psychotherapy(In the early 70s, Colby presented a version of Weizenbaums ELIZA known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. ) was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as computationalism). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.(


Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Kurzweil has used law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029. He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past, a scenario that fiction writer Vinge named the singularity.(


Robot designer Moravec, cyberneticist Warwick and inventor Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.( This idea, called transhumanism, which has roots in Huxley and Ettinger, has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the manga in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.


Fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution, an idea first proposed by Samuel Butlers among the Machines (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.(

McCorduck writes that all these scenarios are expressions of the ancient human desire to, as she calls it, forge the gods.(

This is a central idea of McCorducks Machines That Think. She writes: I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition.

Our history is full of attemptsnutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and realto make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential usbypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldnt, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction.

File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|Steel is a metal alloy whose major component is iron, with carbon content between 0.02% and 2.14% by mass.

An alloy is a homogeneous mixture or metallic solution composed of two or more elements.(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/alloy) Complete solid solution alloys give single solid phase microstructure, while partial solutions give two or more phases that may or may not be homogeneous in distribution, depending on thermal (heat treatment) history. Alloys usually have different properties from those of the component elements.

Alloy constituents are usually measured by mass.

Theory
Alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non-metals that often enhance its properties. For example, steel is stronger than iron, its primary element. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, modulus, and electrical and conductivity, of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as strength(Adelbert Phillo Mills, (1922) Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties, John Wiley &amp; sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison) and strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element occur. For example, impurities in semi-conducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.()()
Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was the first alloy discovered, during the prehistoric period now known as the age; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for ornaments, bells, statues, and bearings. Brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc. 

Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single point, but a melting range in which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases. The temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus, and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus. However, for most alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents (in rare cases two)the eutectic mixturewhich gives the alloy a unique melting point.

Terminology
The term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the base or the matrix. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms, not counting impurities, such as a copper-nickel alloy, then it is called a binary alloy. If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ternary alloy. An alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy, while a five-part alloy is termed a quinary alloy. Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system.(Michael Bauccio (2005) ASM metals reference book, ASM International 2005)

When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism. The relative size of each atom in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are replaced with atoms of the other constituent. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, and so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices.(Jon L. Dossett, Howard E. Boyer (2006) Practical heat treating, ASM International, pp. 1-14)

Alloys are often made to alter the mechanical properties of the base metal, to induce hardness, toughness, ductility, or other desired properties. While most metals and alloys can be work hardened by inducing defects in their crystal structure, caused by deformation, some alloys can also have their properties altered by treatment. Nearly all metals can be softened by annealing, which repairs the crystal defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of aluminum, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree that steel does.( 

At a certain temperature, the base metal of steel, iron, undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called allotropy. This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the crystal. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron. If the iron is cooled slowly, the carbon atoms will be forced out of solution, into the spaces between the crystals. If the steel is cooled quickly, the carbon atoms become trapped in solution, causing the iron crystals to deform when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, inducing great hardness.( 

In practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 karat gold is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the silver used in jewelry and the aluminium used as a structural building material are also alloys.

The term alloy is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an alloy are commonly referred to as simply alloy wheels, although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys.

History


The use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron, a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was.() Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools, weapons, and nails. In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads. They were often used as anvils. Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable, and difficult for ancient people to work.(Vagn Fabritius Buchwald Iron and steel in ancient times, Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 1322)

Iron is usually found as ore on Earth, except for one deposit of iron in Greenland, which was used by the Inuit people.(Vagn Fabritius Buchwald Iron and steel in ancient times, Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 35-37) Native copper, however, was found worldwide, along with silver, gold and platinum, which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since Neolithic times. Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore, and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form bronze, which is much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass.(Vagn Fabritius Buchwald Iron and steel in ancient times, Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 3941) Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as hardness, toughness and point, under various conditions of temperature and hardening, developing much of the information contained in modern alloy constitution diagrams.(

The first known smelting of iron began in Anatolia, around 1800 BC. Called the bloomery process, it produced very soft but ductile iron and, by 800 BC, the technology had spread to Europe. iron, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon, was being produced in China as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. These metals found little practical use until the introduction of steel around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of welding, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal.(Cyril Smith  (1960) History of metallography, MIT Press, ISBN 0262691205 pp. 24)

Mercury had been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form amalgams (an alloy in a soft paste, or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called gilding, such as armor and mirrors. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind.(George Rapp (2009) Archaeomineralogy, Springer, p. 180 ISBN 3540785930) Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.(Harry A. Miskimin (1977) The economy of later Renaissance Europe, 14601600, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521292085, p. 31)

Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient Egypt and Mycenae, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Silver was often found alloyed with gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers.(Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (2000) Ancient Egyptian materials and technology, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521452570 pp. 164167) Around 250 BC, Archimedes was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of Eureka! upon the discovery of principle.(Melvyn Kay (2008) Practical Hydraulics, Taylor and Francis, ISBN 0415351154 p. 45)

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for use in tool and weapon making. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of steel. Huntsmans process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.(George Adam Roberts, George Krauss, Richard Kennedy, Richard L. Kennedy (1998) Tool steels, ASM International, ISBN 0871705990 pp. 23) 

With the introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.( Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow, such as mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese, which exhibits extreme hardness and toughness.(Cast steel: Austenitic Manganese Steels)

Augustus (;( entry Augustus)
;(In Latin, Augustus name would be inscribed as IMPERATOR GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS.)
23 September 63 BC  19 August AD 14) is considered the first emperor of the Empire, which he ruled alone from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD.(The dates of his rule are contemporary dates; Augustus lived under two calendars, the Roman Republican until 45 BC, and the Julian after 45 BC. Due to departures from Julius Caesars intentions, Augustus restored the Julian calendar in 8 BC, and the correspondence between the Julian calendar and the actual calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8 BC.(Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003: 6701)) Born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, he was adopted posthumously by his great-uncle Gaius Julius Caesar in 44 BC via his last will and testament, and between then and 27 BC was officially named Gaius Julius Caesar. In 27 BC the Senate awarded him the honorific Augustus (the revered one), and thus consequently he was Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus.(Formally Imperator Caesar, Divi filius, Augustus which means Imperator Caesar, Son of the Divus (Divus Julius), Augustus.) Because of the various names he bore, it is common to call him Octavius when referring to events between 63 and 44 BC, Octavian (or Octavianus) when referring to events between 44 and 27 BC, and Augustus when referring to events after 27 BC. In Greek sources, Augustus is known as  (Octavius/Oktabios),  (Caesar/Kaisar),  (Augustus/Augustos), or  (Sebastos), depending on context.

The young Octavius came into his inheritance after Caesars assassination in 44 BC. In 43 BC, Octavian joined forces with Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in a dictatorship known as the Triumvirate. As a triumvir, Octavian ruled Rome and many of its provinces.(Some provinces were governed by the Senate.) The triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its rulers: Lepidus was driven into exile, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the of Actium by the fleet of Octavian commanded by Agrippa in 31 BC.

After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Octavian restored the outward facade of the Republic, with governmental power vested in the Senate, but in practice retained his autocratic power. It took several years to determine the exact framework by which a formally republican state could be led by a sole ruler; the result became known as the Empire. The emperorship was never an office like the dictatorship which Caesar and Sulla had held before him; indeed, he declined it when the Roman populace entreated him to take on the dictatorship.(Gruen (2005), 35.) By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including those of tribune of the plebs and censor. He was consul until 23 BC.(Dio (1987), 153.) His substantive power stemmed from financial success and resources gained in conquest, the building of patronage relationships throughout the Empire, the loyalty of many military soldiers and veterans, the authority of the many honors granted by the Senate,( and the respect of the people. Augustus control over the majority of Romes legions established an armed threat that could be used against the Senate, allowing him to coerce the Senates decisions. With his ability to eliminate senatorial opposition by means of arms, the Senate became docile towards him. His rule through patronage, military power, and accumulation of the offices of the defunct Republic became the model for all later imperial governments.

The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Romana, or Roman peace. Despite continuous wars on the frontiers, and one year-long civil war over the imperial succession, the Mediterranean world remained at peace for more than two centuries. Augustus enlarged the empire dramatically, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Raetia, expanded possessions in Africa, and completed the conquest of Hispania. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the empire with states, and made peace with Parthia through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed networks of roads with an official courier system, established a standing army, established the Guard, and created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome. Much of the city was rebuilt under Augustus; and he wrote a record of his own accomplishments, known as the Gestae Divi Augusti, which has survived. Upon his death in AD 14, Augustus was declared a god by the Senateto be worshipped by the Romans.( His names Augustus and Caesar were adopted by every subsequent emperor; and the sixth month of the Roman calendar, previously named Sextilis, was renamed Augustus (August in English) in his honour. He was succeeded by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law), Tiberius.


Early life

While his paternal family was from the town of Velletri, about 25 miles from Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63 BC. He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the Hill, very close to the Forum. He was given the name Gaius Octavius Thurinus, his cognomen possibly commemorating his fathers victory at Thurii over a rebellious band of slaves.(Suetonius, Augustus 7)(56 on-line text.) Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavius was taken to his fathers home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavius only mentions his fathers equestrian family briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather was a military tribune in Sicily during the Punic War. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father, also named Gaius Octavius, had been governor of Macedonia.(Suetonius, Augustus The Marcus Octavius vetoing the law suggested by Gracchus in 133 BC was possibly his ancestor. 14.)(Rowell (1962), 14.) His mother Atia was the niece of Caesar.

In 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died.(Chisholm (1981), 23.) His mother married a former governor of Syria, Marcius Philippus.(Suetonius, Augustus 48; of Damascus, Augustus 3. ) Philippus claimed descent from the Great, and was elected consul in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother (and Julius Caesars sister), Julia Caesaris.

In 52 or 51 BC, Julia Caesaris died. Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.(Suetonius, Augustus 8.1; Quintilian, 12.6.1.) From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the virilis four years later,(Suetonius, Augustus 8.1) and was elected to the of Pontiffs in 47 BC.(Nicolaus of Damascus, Augustus 4. )(Rowell (1962), 16.) The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the of Venus Genetrix, built by Julius Caesar.( According to of Damascus, Octavius wished to join Caesars staff for his campaign in Africa but gave way when his mother protested.(Nicolaus of Damascus, Augustus 6. ) In 46 BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey, Caesars late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.

When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he crossed hostile territory to Caesars camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably.( Velleius Paterculus reports that Caesar afterwards allowed the young man to share his carriage.(Velleius Paterculus 2.59.3.) When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the Virgins, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.(Suetonius, Julius 83.)

Rise to power
Heir to Caesar
File:Gerome Death of Caesar.jpg|thumb|300px|The Death of Caesar, by Grme (1867). On 15 March 44 BC, Octaviuss adoptive father Julius Caesar was assassinated by a conspiracy led by Junius Brutus and Cassius Longinus.

At the time Caesar was killed on the of March (the 15th) 44 BC, Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in Illyria. Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia, he sailed to Italia to ascertain if he had any potential political fortunes or security.(Eck (2003), 9.) After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, he learned the contents of Caesars will, and only then did he decide to become Caesars political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.(((Appian, Civil Wars 3.911.) Having no living legitimate children,(His daughter Julia had died in 54 BC.) Caesar had adopted his great-nephew Octavius as his son and main heir.(Rowell (1962), 15.) Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncles name, Gaius Julius Caesar. Although Romans who had been adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g. Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.) there is no evidence that he ever bore the name Octavianus, as it would have made his modest origins too obvious.(Mackay (2004), 160.)((Southern, Augustus pp.2021) However, despite the fact that he never officially bore the name Octavianus, to save confusing the dead dictator with his heir, historians often refer to the new Caesarbetween his adoption and his assumption, in 27 BC, of the name Augustusas Octavian.(Southern, Augustus pp.21) Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius, in his work of the Twelve Caesars, describes Antonys accusation as political slander.(Suetonius, Augustus 68, 71.)

To make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy, Octavian could not rely on his limited funds.(Eck (2003), 910.) After a warm welcome by Caesars soldiers at Brundisium,( Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against Parthia in the Middle East.( This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.(Rowell (1962), 18.) A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds made no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senates arch enemy, Mark Antony.(Rowell (1962), 19.) Octavian made another bold move in 44 BC when without official permission he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Romes Eastern province to Italy.(Eck (2003), 10.)(Eder (2005), 18.) Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesars veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar.((Appian, Civil Wars 3.1112.) On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavians presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesars former veterans stationed in Campania.( By June he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 denarii.(Chisholm (1981), 24.)(Chisholm (1981), 27.)(Rowell (1962), 20.)


Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC,( Octavian found the consul Antony, Caesars former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictators assassins; they had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March, yet Antony succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome.( This was due to his inflammatory eulogy given at Caesars funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.( Although Mark Antony was amassing political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he at first opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.(Eck (2003), 11.) Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesars money to him. However, during the summer he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts to get rid of Antonius.(Syme (1939), 114120.) In September, the Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying Antony as the greatest threat to the order of the Senate.(Chisholm (1981), 26.)(Rowell (1962), 30.) With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws which would lend him control over Gaul, which had been assigned as part of his province, from Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesars assassins.(Eck (2003), 1112.)(Rowell (1962), 21.) Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans, and on 28 November won over two of Antonys legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.(Syme (1939), 123126.)(Eck (2003), 12.)(Rowell (1962), 23.) In the face of Octavians large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome, and to the relief of the Senate he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January.(

First conflict with Antony
File:Bust of augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Augustus in Capitolini, Rome
After Decimus Brutus refused to give up Gaul, Antony besieged him at Mutina.(Rowell (1962), 24.) The resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the violence were rejected by Antony, as the Senate had no army of its own to challenge him; this provided an opportunity for Octavian, who was already known to have armed forces.( Cicero also defended Octavian against Antonys taunts about Octavians lack of noble lineage; he stated we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth.(Chisholm (1981), 29.)  This was in part a rebuttal to Antonys opinion of Octavian, as Cicero quoted Antony saying to Octavian, You, boy, owe everything to your name.(Chisholm (1981), 30.)(Rowell (1962), 1920.) In this unlikely alliance orchestrated by the arch anti-Caesarian senator Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on  1 January 43 BC, yet he was also given the power to vote alongside the former consuls.(( In addition, Octavian was granted imperium (commanding power), which made his command of troops legal, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43 BC).((Syme (1939), 167.) In April of 43 BC, Antonys forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony to retreat to Gaul. However, both consuls were killed, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.(Syme (1939), 173174)(Scullard (1982), 157.)

After heaping many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than  Octavian for defeating Antony, the Senate attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus, yet Octavian decided not to cooperate.(Rowell (1962), 2627.) Instead, Octavian stayed in the Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony.(Rowell (1962), 27.) In July, an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa.(Chisholm (1981), 3233.) Octavian also demanded that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy should be rescinded.( When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions.( He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on  19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative Pedius as co-consul.(Eck (2003), 14.)(Rowell (1962), 28.) Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.(Syme (1939), 176186.)

Second Triumvirate
Proscriptions

Both sides bear the inscription III VIR R P C, meaning One of Three Men for the Regulation of the Republic.()

In a meeting near Bologna in October of 43 BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a junta called the Triumvirate.( This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law passed by the plebs, unlike the unofficial Triumvirate formed by Pompey Magnus, Caesar and Licinius Crassus.(Eck (2003), 15.)(Scullard (1982), 163.) The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which allegedly 300 senators and 2,000 equites were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.( The estimation that 300 senators were proscribed was presented by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed.(Southern (1998), 5253.) This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay their troops salaries for the upcoming conflict against Caesars assassins, Junius Brutus and Cassius Longinus.(Scullard (1982), 164.) Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.(Eck (2003), 16.)

Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing. However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies.(Scott (1933), 1920.) Velleius Paterculus asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them.( Dio defended Augustus as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.( This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies.(Scott (1933), 20.) Suetonius presents the case that Octavian, although reluctant at first to proscribe officials, nonetheless pursued his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs.( Plutarch describes the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family between Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Julius Caesar IV, and Lepidus his brother Paulus.(Scott (1933), 19.)

Battle of Philippi and division of territory

On 1 January 42 BC, the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, Iulius. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was filius, Son of God.(Syme (1939), 202.) Antony and Octavian then sent 28 legions by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece.(Eck (2003), 17.) After two battles at Philippi in Macedonia in October of 42, the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed suicide. Mark Antony would later use the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antonys forces.(Eck (2003), 1718.) In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to Vipsanius Agrippa instead.(

After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. While Antony placed Gaul, the provinces of Hispania, and Italia in the hands of Octavian, Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra VII, the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesars infant son, Caesarion. Lepidus was left with the province of Africa, stymied by Antony who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.(Eck (2003), 18.)  Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius, who could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, also required land.( There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland; Octavian chose the former.(Eck (2003), 1819.)  There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.(Eck (2003), 19.)

Rebellion and marriage alliances

Widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over his soldiers settlements encouraged many to rally at the side of Lucius Antonius, who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate.(  Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from Pulchra, the daughter of Fulvia and her first husband Clodius Pulcher. Claiming that his marriage with Clodia had never been consummated, he returned her to her mother, Mark Antonys wife. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antonys rights against Octavian. However, Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries.( Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at Perusia (modern Perugia), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC.( Lucius and his army were spared due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon.(Rowell (1962), 32.) However, Octavian showed no mercy for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesars assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.(Eck (2003), 20.) Perusia was also pillaged and burned as a warning for others.( This bloody event sullied Octavians reputation and was criticized by many, such as the Augustan poet Propertius.(

Pompeius, son of the First Triumvir Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesars victory over his father, was established in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39 BC.(Scullard (1982), 162) Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, who was ironically a member of the republican party, not the Caesarian faction.( Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance when in 40 BC he married Scribonia, a daughter of Scribonius Libo who was a follower of Pompeius as well as his father-in-law.( Scribonia conceived Octavians only natural child, Julia, who was born the same day that he divorced Scribonia to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after his marriage.(

While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three children with her.(Helios, Selene II and Ptolemy Philadelphus) Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40 BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. However, this new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit.(Eck (2003) 21.)(Eder (2005), 19.) Meanwhile in Sicyon, Antonys wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvias death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.(( In the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East.( To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40 BC.( During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as Major and Minor).

War with Pompeius

Sextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying to the peninsula shipments of grain through the Mediterranean; Pompeius own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy.( Pompeius control over the sea prompted him to take on the name Neptuni filius, son of Neptune.(Eck (2003), 22.) A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39 BC with the treaty of Misenum; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and the Peloponnese, and ensured him a future position as consul for  35 BC.(( The territorial agreement amongst the triumvirs and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on  17 January 38 BC.(Eck (2003), 23.) One of Pompeius naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. However Octavian needed Antonys additional support to attack Pompeius, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirates extension for another five-year period beginning in 37 BC.(Scullard (1982), 163)(Eck (2003), 24.) In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Romes defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC.( In an agreement reached at Tarentum, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia.(Eck (2003), 25.) However, Octavian sent only a tenth the number of those promised, which was viewed by Antony as an intentional provocation.(

Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36 BC.(Eck (2003), 2526.) Despite setbacks for Octavian, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by general Agrippa at the naval of Naulochus.( Sextus fled with his remaining forces to the east, where he was captured and executed in Miletus by one of Antonys generals the following year.(Eck (2003), 26.)  Both Lepidus and Octavian gathered the surrendered troops of Pompeius, yet Lepidus felt empowered enough to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave.(  However, Lepidus troops deserted him and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and found Octavians promises of money to be enticing.( Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of maximus (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and was effectively exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy.((Scullard (1982), 164) The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. To maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire, Octavian ensured Romes citizens of their rights to property. This time he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy while returning 30,000 slaves to former Roman owners that had previously fled to Pompeius to join his army and navy.(Eck (2003), 2627.)  To ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome, Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister tribunal immunity, or sacrosanctitas.(Eck (2003), 2728.)

War with Antony

Meanwhile, Antonys campaign against Parthia turned disastrous, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces.(Eck (2003), 29.) On the other hand, Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength, and since he was already engaged in a romantic affair with her, he decided to send Octavia back to Rome.(Eck (2003), 2930.) Octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an Oriental paramour.(Eck (2003), 30.) In 36 BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end, and that he would step down as triumvir if only Antony would do the same; Antony refused.(Eder (2005), 20.)

After Roman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34 BC, Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia; he also awarded the title Queen of Kings to Cleopatra, acts which Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome.( When Octavian became consul once again on  1 January 33 BC, he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antonys grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.(Eck (2003), 31.)  Defecting consuls and senators rushed over to the side of Antony in disbelief of the propaganda (which turned out to be true), yet so did able ministers desert Antony for Octavian in the autumn of 32 BC.(Eck (2003), 3234.) These defectors, Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius, gave Octavian the information he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations he made against Antony.(Eck (2003), 34.) By storming the sanctuary of the Vestal Virgins, Octavian forced their chief priestess to hand over Antonys secret will, which would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, alongside plans to build a tomb in Alexandria for him and his queen to reside upon their deaths.(Eck (2003), 3435)(Eder (2005), 2122.) In late 32 BC, the Senate officially revoked Antonys powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatras regime in Egypt.(Eck (2003), 35.)(Eder (2005), 22.)
File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|left|The of Actium, by Lorenzo Castro, painted 1672, National Maritime Museum, London

In early 31 BC, while Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece, Octavian gained a preliminary victory when the navy under the command of Agrippa successfully ferried troops across the Sea.(Eck (2003), 37.) While Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatras main force from their supply routes at sea, Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and marched south.( Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antonys army fled to Octavians side daily while Octavians forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.( In a desperate attempt to break free of the naval blockade, Antonys fleet sailed through the bay of Actium on the western coast of Greece. It was there that Antonys fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Sosius in the of Actium on  2 September 31 BC.(Eck (2003), 38.) Antony and his remaining forces were only spared due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatras fleet that had been waiting nearby.(Eck (2003), 3839.) Octavian pursued them, and after another defeat in Alexandria on  1 August 30 BC, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide; Antony fell on his own sword and into Cleopatras arms, while she let a venomous snake bite her.(Eck (2003), 39.) Having exploited his position as Caesars heir to further his own political career, Octavian was only too well aware of the dangers in allowing another to do so and, reportedly commenting that two Caesars are one too many, he ordered CaesarionJulius Caesars son by Cleopatrato be killed, whilst sparing Cleopatras children by Antony, with the exception of Antonys older son.(Green (1990), 697.)(Scullard (1982), 171.)

Octavian had previously shown little mercy to military combatants and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.(

Octavian becomes Augustus
File:Octavian aureus circa 30 BCE.jpg|thumb|Aureus of Octavian, circa 30 BC, Museum
After Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate,(Gruen (2005), 3435.) but would have to achieve this through incremental power gains, courting the Senate and the people, while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, to appear that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy.((  Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.(  Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot.  At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars amongst the Roman generals, and even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the provinces.  Octavians aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections in name at least.(Eck (2003), 4445.)

First settlement

File:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustus as a magistrate. The statues marble head was made c. 3020 BC, the body sculpted in the 2nd century AD (Louvre, Paris).

In BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies.(  Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing bills for senatorial debate.(Eck (2003), 45.)  Although Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike.(  The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power in the Roman Republic was unrivaled.(  The historian Eck states:

The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire.  All of them taken together formed the basis of his auctoritas, which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.(Eck (2003), 113.)

To a large extent the public was aware of the vast financial resources Augustus commanded.  When he failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy, he undertook direct responsibility for them in BC.(Eck (2003), 80.)  This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni, the public treasury.(

According to H.H. Scullard, however, Augustuss power was based on the exercise of a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised.(Scullard (1982), 211.)

The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Romes civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The senates proposal was a ratification of Octavians extra-constitutional power. Through the senate Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.(Eck (2003), 46.)(Scullard (1982), 210.)  The provinces ceded to him, that he might pacify them within the promised ten-year period, comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt.((Gruen (2005), 34.) Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Romes legions.((Eck (2003), 47.)

While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure his orders were carried out.( On the other hand, the provinces not under Octavians control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate.( Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power.( The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional producer of grain, as well as Illyria and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions.( However, with control of only five or six legions distributed amongst three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Augustus, the Senates control of these regions did not amount to any political or martial challenge to Octavian.(CCAA, 2425.)( The Senates control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican faade for the autocratic Principate.( Also, Octavians control of entire provinces for the objective of securing peace and creating stability followed Republican-era precedents, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.(

In January of 27 BC, the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of Augustus and Princeps.(Eck (2003), 50.) Augustus, from the Latin word Augere (meaning to increase), can be translated as the illustrious one.(Eck (2003), 49.) It was a title of religious rather than political authority.( According to Roman religious beliefs, the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanityand in fact naturethat went beyond any constitutional definition of his status. After the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, the change in name would also serve to demarcate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian. His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than Romulus, the previous one he styled for himself in reference to the story of and Remus (founders of Rome), which would symbolize a second founding of Rome.( However, the title of Romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image Octavian tried to avoid.(Eck (2003), 149) Princeps, comes from the Latin phrase primum caput, the first head, originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial roster; in the case of Augustus it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge.(Eck (2003), 3, 149.) Princeps had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, Pompey had held the title.  Augustus also styled himself as Imperator Caesar divi filius, Commander Caesar son of the deified one.( With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, but the use of Imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.( The word Caesar was merely a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family, yet Augustus transformed Caesar into a new family line that began with him.(

Augustus was granted the right to hang the civica, the civic crown made from oak, above his door and have laurels drape his doorposts.(Eder (2005), 24.) This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a triumph, with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat mori, or, Remember, you are mortal, to the triumphant general. Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests. Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital. However, Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter, wearing a diadem, or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor Julius Caesar.(Eder (2005), 13.) If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the Curia, bearing the inscription virtus, pietas, clementia, iustitiavalor, piety, clemency, and justice.(Eck (2003), 3.)(

Second settlement
By 23 BC, some of the implications of the settlement of 27 BC were becoming apparent. Augustus holding of an annual consulate made his dominance over the Roman political system too obvious, whilst at the same time halving the opportunities for others to achieve what was still purported to be the head of the Roman state.(Wells, pg. 51)  Further, his desire to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn was causing political problems(If the testimony of Primus can be believed, where during his trial for illegally launching a war in Thrace, he asserted that he acted on the orders of Marcellus and Augustus  see Southern, pg. 108 and Eck (2003), pg. 55) and alienating his three biggest supporters  Agrippa, Maecenas and Livia.(Holland, pg. 294)  Feeling pressure from his own core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate in an attempt to bolster his support there, especially with the Republicans; after his choice for co-consul in 23 BC, Terentius Varro Murena died before taking office(Ando, pg. 140; Raaflaub, pg. 426; Wells, pg. 53) he appointed the noted Republican Calpurnius Piso, who had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus.(Davies, pg. 259)

In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the Principate in some form,(Southern, pg. 108; Holland, pg. 295) whilst at the same time put in doubt the senators suspicions of his anti-republicanism.(Eder (2005), 25.)(Eck (2003), 56.)  Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa.((  However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed.(( This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.(Gruen (2005), 38.) Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility amongst the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.(Gruen (2005), 3839.)  With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position;(Stern, Gaius, Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus vision of a new world order in 13 BC, pg. 23) nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, it was Augustus intent to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that no matter what the constitutional rules were, they would continue to obey Agrippa.(Holland, pgs. 294-295; Southern, pg. 108)

File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Augustus wearing a gorgoneion on a three layered sardonyx cameo, AD 14/20
Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his permanent consulship.( The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 BC,((Eder (2005), 26.) both times to introduce his grandsons into public life.(Davies, pg. 259)  Although he had resigned as consul, Augustus retained his consular imperium, leading to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.(Eck (2003), 57.) This was a clever ploy by Augustus; by stepping down as one of two consuls, this allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position, while at the same time Augustus could exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.( Augustus was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position over the Roman provinces remained unchanged as he became a proconsul.((Gruen (2005), 37.) Earlier as a consul he had the power to intervene, when he deemed necessary, with the affairs of provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate.(Eck (2003), 5657.) As a proconsul Augustus did not want this authority of overriding provincial governors to be stripped from him, so imperium proconsulare maius, or power over all the proconsuls was granted to Augustus by the Senate.( The existence of imperium maius is debated by scholars, and it is also argued that he was only granted imperium aequum, or power equal to that of the governors, but his supreme influence allowed him to control the affairs of the provinces.

Augustus was also granted the power of a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the official title of tribune.( Legally it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired years ago when adopted by Julius Caesar.(Gruen (2005), 36.) This allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before it, veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, preside over elections, and the right to speak first at any meeting.((Eck (2003), 5758.) Also included in Augustus tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.(Eck (2003), 59.) With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all other attire besides the classic toga while entering the Forum.(Eder (2005), 30.) There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.(Bunson (1994), 80.) Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state, however this position did not extend to the censors ability to hold a census and determine the Senates roster. The office of the tribune plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustus amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship.(Bunson (1994), 427.)

File:CaesarAugustusPontiusMaximusCloseup.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Labicana AugustusAugustus as Maximus
In addition to tribunician authority, Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself: all armed forces in the city, formerly under the control of the prefects and consuls, were now under the sole authority of Augustus.(Eck (2003), 60.)  With maius imperium proconsulare, Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph as he was ostensibly the head of every Roman army.(Eck (2003), 61.) In 19 BC, Lucius Cornelius Balbus, governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes, was the first man of provincial origin to receive this award, as well as the last.( For every following Roman victory the credit was given to Augustus, because Romes armies were commanded by the legatus, who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.( Augustus eldest son by marriage to Livia, Tiberius, was the only exception to this rule when he received a triumph for victories in Germania in 7 BC.(Eck (2003), 117.) Ensuring that his status of maius imperium proconsulare was renewed in 13 BC, Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support.(

Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class. When Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC, fears arose once again that Augustus was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19 BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.(Dio 54.1, 6, 10.) In 22 BC there was a food shortage in Rome which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis.( After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Romes grain supply by virtue of his proconsular imperium, and ended the crisis almost immediately.( It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.(Eck (2003), 78.)

Nevertheless, the were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio and Lucinius Varro Murena.(Southern, pg. 109; Holland, pg. 299)  In early 22 BC, charges were brought against Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, of waging a war on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, whose king was a Roman ally, without prior approval of the Senate.(Wells, pg. 53)  He was defended by Murena, who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state.(Southern, pg. 108)  Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus.(Holland, pg. 300)  Under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senates prerogative, as Macedonia was under the Senates jurisdiction, not the Princeps. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals.(Southern, pg. 108)  Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustuss policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy  accusations that had already played out during the crisis of 23 BC.(Stern, Gaius, Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus vision of a new world order in 13 BC, pg. 23)

The situation was so serious, that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.(Syme, pg. 333)  Murena, disbelieving Augustuss testimony and resentful of his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas, rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest.(Syme, pg. 333; Holland, pg. 300; Southern, pg, 108)  Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustuss testimony.(Wells, pg. 53; Raaflaub, pg. 426)  Then, sometime prior to September 1, 22 BC a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio against the Princeps.(Swan, pg. 241; Syme, pg. 483)  Murena was named among the conspirators. Tried in absentia, with Tiberius acting as prosecutor, the jury found the conspirators guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict.(Wells, pg. 53; Holland, pg. 301)  Sentenced to death for treason, all the accused were executed as soon as they were captured without ever giving testimony in their defence.(Davies, pg. 260; Holland, pg. 301)  Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.(Holland, pg. 301)

In 19 BC, the Senate voted to allow Augustus to wear the consuls insignia in public and before the Senate,( as well as sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces, an emblem of consular authority.(Gruen (2005), 43.)  Like his tribune authority, the granting of consular powers to him was another instance of holding power of offices he did not actually hold.( This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was actually a consul, the importance was that he appeared as one before the people. On 6 March 12 BC, after the death of Lepidus, he additionally took up the position of maximus, the high priest of the collegium of the Pontifices, the most important position in Roman religion.(Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, Res Gestae 10.2. Dio 27.2 reports this under 13 BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).)(Eder (2005), 28.)  On  5 February 2 BC, Augustus was also given the title patriae, or father of the country.(Mackay (2004), 186.)(Eck (2003), 129.)

Later Roman Emperors would generally be limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often, to display humility, newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had actually been granted them by the Senate. The civic crown, which later Emperors took to actually wearing, consular insignia, and later the purple robes of a Triumphant general (picta) became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.

War and expansion

The yellow legend represents the extent of the Republic in 31 BC, the shades of green represent gradually conquered territories under the reign of Augustus, and pink areas on the map represent states; however, areas under Roman control shown here were subject to change even during Augustus reign, especially in Germania.

Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus chose Imperator, victorious commander to be his first name, since he wanted to make the notion of victory associated with him emphatically clear.(Eck (2003), 93.) By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed imperator as his title after a successful battle.( Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the Res Gestae was devoted to his military victories and honors.( Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet Virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: tu regere imperio populos, Romane, mementoRoman, remember by your strength to rule the Earths peoples!( The impulse for expansionism, apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, is accorded divine sanction by Virgils Jupiter, who in Book 1 of the Aeneid promises Rome imperium sine fine, sovereignty without limit.(Eck (2003), 95.)
File:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Tiberius, a successful military commander under Augustus before he was designated as his heir and successor

By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal),(Eck (2003), 94.) the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia),( Illyricum and Pannonia (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.),( and extended the borders of the Province to the east and south.( After the reign of the client king the Great (734 BC), Judea was added to the province of Syria when Augustus deposed his successor Archelaus.( Like Egypt which had been conquered after the defeat of Antony in 30 BC, Syria was governed not by a proconsul or legate of Augustus, but a high prefect of the equestrian class.( Again, no military effort was needed in 25 BC when Galatia (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after of Galatia was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada.( When the rebellious tribes of Cantabria in modern-day Spain were finally quelled in 19 BC, the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and Lusitania.(Eck (2003), 97.) This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman mining projects, especially the very rich gold deposits at Medulas for example.(

Conquering the peoples of the Alps in 16 BC was another important victory for Rome since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Romes enemies in Germania to the north.(Eck (2003), 98.) The poet Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion.(Eck (2003), 9899.) The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12 BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum and his brother Claudius Drusus against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland.(Eck (2003), 99.) Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus forces reached the Elbe River by 9 BC, yet he died shortly after by falling off his horse.( It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brothers body all the way back to Rome.(

To protect Romes eastern territories from the Empire, Augustus relied on the states of the east to act as territorial buffers and areas which could raise their own troops for defense.(Eck (2003), 96.) To ensure security of the Empires eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Romes diplomat to the East.( Tiberius was responsible for restoring Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.( Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with IV of Parthia (372 BC) in 20 BC for the return of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome.(Bunson (1994), 416.)((Brosius (2006), 9697, 136138.) Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus defeat by military means.(Eck (2003), 9596.) However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor (Mars the Avenger) built to house the standards.(Brosius (2006), 97; see also Bivar (1983), 6667.)

Although Parthia always posed a threat to Rome in the east, the real battlefront was along the  Rhine and Danube rivers.( Before the final fight with Antony, Octavians campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia was the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube.(Rowell (1962), 13.) Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Romes enemies in Germania.( A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Quinctilius Varus were destroyed with few survivors by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally.(Eck (2003), 101102.) Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany.(Bunson (1994), 417.) The Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated  Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.(Bunson (1994), 31.)

Death and succession
File:Augustus Tiberius aureus.png|left|thumb|A Roman aureus struck under Augustus, c. AD 1314; the reverse shows Tiberius riding on a quadriga, celebrating the fifteenth renewal of his tribunal power. At least six potential heirs, including Agrippa and his sons, had expired or proven incapable of succeeding Augustus, before he finally settled on Tiberius in AD 9.

The illness of Augustus in 23 BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.( If someone was to succeed his unofficial position of power, they were going to have to earn it through their own publicly proven merits.(Gruen (2005), 50.) Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sisters son Marcellus, who had been quickly married to Augustus daughter the Elder.(Eck (2003), 114115.) Other historians dispute this due to Augustus will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC,(Eck (2003), 115.) instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.( After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Caesar, Caesar, Julia, the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean.(Gruen (2005), 44.)(Eck (2003), 58.)  Although this granting of power would have shown Augustus favor for Agrippa, it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.(

Augustus intent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs was apparent when he adopted them as his own children.(Syme (1939), 416417.) He took the consulship in 5 and 2 BC so he could personally usher them into their political careers,(Scullard (1982), 217.) and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.(Syme (1939), 417.) Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livias children from her first marriage, Claudius Drusus Germanicus and Tiberius Claudius, granting them military commands and public office, and seeming to favor Drusus. However, Drusus marriage to Antonia, Augustus niece, was a relationship far too embedded within the family to disturb over succession issues.( After Agrippa died in 12 BC, Livias son Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania and marry Agrippas widow, Augustus daughter Juliaas soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.(Eck (2003), 116.) While Drusus marriage to Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, Vipsania was only the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.(

File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|of Augustus
Tiberius shared in Augustus tribune powers as of 6 BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to Rhodes.((Gruen (2005), 46.) Although no specific reason is known for his departure, it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia.(( It could very well have been from feelings of jealousy and being left out since Augustus young grandchildren-turned-sons, Gaius and Lucius, joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.(Eck (2003), 117118.)(Gruen (2005), 4647.) After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus.(Eck (2003), 119.) This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.( In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustus.(Eck (2003), 119120.) The only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him.( He certainly fell out of Augustus favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character.(Gruen (2005), 49.) Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus.

On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting the place of his fathers death at Nola, and Tiberiuswho was present alongside Livia at Augustus deathbedwas named his heir.(Eck (2003), 123.) Augustus famous last words were, Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exitreferring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble. An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.( Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra.(Eck (2003), 124.) Coffin-bound, Augustus body was cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman pantheon.( In 410, during the Sack of Rome, the mausoleum was despoiled by the Goths and his ashes scattered.

The historian D.C.A. Shotter states that Augustus policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latters death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.(Shotter (1966), 210212.) Shotter suggests that Augustus deification, coupled with Tiberius extremely conservative attitude towards religion, obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment he might have harbored.(Shotter (1966), 211.) Also, the historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits.( Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her) as well as the two young Caesars Gaius and Lucius, instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.(

Legacy


Augustus reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate decline of the Western Roman Empire and until the of Constantinople in 1453. Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title Augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at Old Rome and at New Rome. In many languages, caesar became the word for emperor, as in the German Kaiser and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian Tsar. The cult of Divus Augustus continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to Christianity in 391 by I. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the Gestae Divi Augusti, to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum.(Suetonius, Augustus 101.4.) Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.(Eck (2003), 12) The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in Ankara dubbed the Monumentum Ancyranum, called the queen of inscriptions by historian Mommsen.(Eck (2003), 2.) There are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived. This includes his poems Sicily, Epiphanus, and Ajax, an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written rebuttal to Brutus Eulogy of Cato.(Bunson (1994), 47.) However, historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.(Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.)(Bourne (1918), 5366.)

Many consider Augustus to be Romes greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empires life span and initiated the celebrated Pax Romana or Pax Augusta. He was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Caesar, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Romes first institutionalized police force, fighting force, and the establishment of the municipal prefect as a permanent office.( The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.( A praefectus vigilum, or Prefect of the Watch was put in charge of the vigiles, Romes fire brigade and police.(Bunson (1994), 345.) With Romes civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a army for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.(Eck (2003), 8587.) This was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.(Eck (2003), 86.) With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum.( Besides the advent of swifter communication amongst Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Romes armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.(Chisholm (1981), 122.) In the year 6 Augustus established the aerarium militare, donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.(Bunson (1994), 6.) One of the most lasting institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Guard in 27 BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.(Bunson (1994), 341.) They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Praetoria.(Bunson (1994), 341342.)

Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.( He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities.(Eder (2005), 23.) In 28 BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.(

The longevity of Augustus reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.(Tacitus, Annals I.3) Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a facto monarchy in these years. Augustus own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperors expense. Augustus ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.( The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.(Kelsall (1976), 120.) However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist Antistius Labeo (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican liberty in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime.(Starr (1952), 5.) In the beginning of his Annals, the Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery.( He continued to say that, with Augustus death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.( Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:




According to the second opposing opinion:


In a recent biography on Augustus, Anthony Everitt asserts that through the centuries, judgments on Augustus reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that:



Tacitus was of the belief that Nerva (r. 9698) successfully mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty.(Starr (1952), 6.) The 3rd century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat.( The poet Annaeus Lucanus (AD 3965) was of the opinion that Caesars victory over Pompey and the fall of the Younger (95 BC46 BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.(

The Anglo-Irish writer Swift (16671745), in his Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome, criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed Britains virtuous monarchy to Romes moral Republic of the 2nd century BC.(Kelsall (1976), 118.) In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian Thomas Gordon (16581741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant Cromwell (15991658).( Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher Montesquieu (16891755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.(Kelsall (1976), 119.) In his Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, the Scottish scholar Thomas Blackwell (17011757) deemed Augustus a Machiavellian ruler, a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper, wicked and worthless, a mean spirit, and a tyrant.(

Revenue reforms

Augustus public revenue reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empires expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus predecessors had done.( This reform greatly increased Romes net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.(Eck (2003), 8384.) The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province.(Bunson (1994), 404.) Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.( Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the of kin.(

An equally important reform was the abolition of private farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors that raised taxes had been the norm in the Republican era, and some had grown powerful enough to influence the amount of votes for politicians in Rome.( The tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations, as well as great private wealth, by winning the right to tax local areas.( Romes revenue was the amount of the successful bids, and the tax farmers profits consisted of any additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Romes blessing. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers desire to maximize their profits, had produced a system of arbitrary exactions that was often barbarously cruel to taxpayers, widely (and accurately) perceived as unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.

The use of Egypts immense land rents to finance the Empires operations resulted from Augustus conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.(Bunson (1994), 144.) As it was effectively considered Augustus private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperors patrimonium.(Bunson (1994), 144145.) Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard.(Bunson (1994), 145.) The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions,( as well as bread and circuses for the population of Rome.

Month of August
The month of August (Latin: Augustus) is named after Augustus; until his time it was called Sextilis (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original calendar and the Latin word for six is sex). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Caesars July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see calendar). According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.(Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.35.)

Building projects


File:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the Pacis (Altar of Peace), 13 BC to 9 BC
On his deathbed, Augustus boasted I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble. Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empires strength.(Dio 56.30.3) Marble could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.(  Although this did not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the Martius, with the Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt.(Eck (2003), 122.) The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus triumphs in the Res Gestae.(Bunson (1994), 32.) Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.(  He also built the of Caesar, the of Agrippa, and the of Augustus with its of Mars Ultor. Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippas construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, of Marcellus). Even his of Augustus was built before his death to house members of his family.(Eck (2003), 118121) To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the Arch of Augustus was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the of Castor and Pollux, and widened in 19 BC to include a triple-arch design.( There are also many buildings outside of the city of Rome that bear Augustus name and legacy, such as the Theatre of Merida in modern Spain, the Carre built at Nmes in todays southern France, as well as the of Augustus at Turbie, located near Monaco.

After the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Romes water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense.(Eck (2003), 79.) In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Romes aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.( In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum (translated as Supervisors of Public Property) was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.(  Augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum (translated as Supervisors for Roads) for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.(Eck (2003), 81.)

The order of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.(Bunson (1994), 34.) Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.(

Physical appearance
The biographer Suetonius describes Augustus outward appearance as follows: He was unusually handsome ... He had clear, bright eyes ... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclining to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature ...(Suetonius, Augustus 79, translated by J. C. Rolfe.)

The Andes is the worlds longest continental range. It is a continual range of highlands along the western coast of America. This range is about  long, about  to  wide (widest between 18 degrees South and 20 degrees South latitude), and of an average height of about .

Along its length, the Andes is split into several ranges, which are  separated by intermediate depressions. The Andes is the location of several high plateaux  some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogot, Arequipa, Medelln, Sucre, and Paz.

The so-called Altiplano plateau is the worlds second-highest plateau following the plateau. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries; Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

The Andes range is the worlds highest mountain range outside of the continent of Asia. The highest peak, Mt. Aconcagua, rises to an elevation of about  above level. The peak of Mt. Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is farther from the centre of the Earth than any other location on the Earths surface. This is because of the bulge that results from the Earths rotation. The worlds highest volcanoes are in the Andes, including del Salado on the Chile-Argentina frontier which rises to 6,893 m (22,615 ft), and over 50 other volcanoes that rise above 6,000 m.

Name
The etymology of the word Andes has been debated. The major consensus is that it derives from the Quechua word anti, which means high crest. Others believe that Andes comes from Suyu, one of the four regions of the Inca empire. It is more likely however that the word Antisuyo derives from the use of Anti to designate mountain chains. Derivation from the Spanish andn (in the sense of cultivation terrace) has also been proposed, yet considered very unlikely.

Geography
thumb|Aerial view of Aconcagua.
The Andes can be divided into three sections: 

I. The Southern Andes in Argentina and Chile;

II. The Central Andes, including the Chilean and Peruvian cordilleras and parts of Bolivia;

III. The Northern Andes in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador that consists of two parallel ranges, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Oriental. In Colombia, north of its the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, the western, central, and eastern ranges. (The cordillera occidental, central, and oriental).

In the northern part of the Andes, the isolated Nevada de Santa Marta range is often considered to be part of the Andes. The eastern range of Colombia is the only one that extends to Venezuela.(Andes travel map) The term cordillera comes from the Spanish word meaning cuerda, meaning rope. The Andes range is about  wide throughout its length, except in the Bolivian flexure where it is about  wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaao, which lie in the Sea off the coast of Venezuela, were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the Andes range, but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the South-American and Caribbean plates.(
)

Geology


The Andes are a Mesozoic  Tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Ring of Fire, a zone of activity that encompasses the Pacific rim of the Americas as well as the Asia-Pacific region. The Andes are the result of tectonics processes, caused by the subduction of crust beneath the American plate. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of western rim of the American Plate due to the subduction of the Plate and the Plate. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several basins such as Orinoco, Basin, Madre de Dios and Chaco which separates the Andes from the ancient cratons in eastern South America. In the south the Andes shares a long boundary with the former Patagonia Terrane. To the west, the Andes end at the Ocean, although the trench can be considered its ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography.

Orogeny

The western rim of the American Plate has been the place of several pre-Andean orogenies since at least the  of the late Proterozoic and early Paleozoic when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern South America, by then the South American part of Gondwana.

The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic when Pangea began to break up and several rifts developed. It continued through the Jurassic Period. It was during the Cretaceous Period that the Andes began to take its present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and erosion.

Tectonic forces above the zone along the entire west coast of South America where the Plate and a part of the Plate are sliding beneath the American Plate continue to produce an ongoing orogenic event resulting in minor to major earthquakes and eruptions to this day. In the extreme south a major fault separates del Fuego from the small Plate. Across the  wide Passage lie the mountains of the Peninsula south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain.

Volcanism

Image:Browncanyonquilotoa.jpg|thumb|valley near Quilotoa, Ecuador.
thumb|Astronaut photograph with the high plains of the Andes Mountains in the foreground, with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert.

The Andes range has many active volcanoes, which are distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity. The Andean volcanism is a result of subduction of the Plate and Plate underneath the American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighboring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for calc-alkalic and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extrensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of ridges and seamount chains apart from a large range on crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.

Ore deposits and evaporites
The Andes mountains host large ore and salt deposits and some of its eastern and thrust belt acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of hydrocarbons. In the forelands of the desert some of the largest copper mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the 1st and 2nd largest exporters of copper in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by hydrothermal fluids (mostly water) during the cooling of plutons or volcanic systems.  The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of water. The dry climate in the central western Andes have also led to the creation of extensive saltpeter deposits which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the salars of Atacama and Uyuni, the first one being the largest source of lithium at present day and the second the worlds largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and Neogene plutonism in Bolivias Cordillera Central created the Bolivian tin belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of Rico de Potos.

Climate and hydrology

thumb|Central Andes
thumb|Astronaut photograph of the Central Andes

The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on location, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of  in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The line depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 m (14,800&amp;ndash;15,800 ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to 4,800&amp;ndash;5,200 m (15,800&amp;ndash;17,060 ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30S, then descending to  on Aconcagua at 32S,  at 40S,  at 50S, and only  in del Fuego at 55S; from 50S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.()

The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones; the Andes and the Andes. Since the Dry Andes extends from the latitudes of Desert to the area of River, precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the ablation area or in the accumulation area.

In the high Andes of central Chile and Province glaciers are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to radiation.(Jan-Christoph Otto, Joachim Gtz, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Dario Trombotto, and Lothar Schrott (2010). Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system - Morenas Coloradas valley (Cordon del Plata, Mendoza, Argentina))

Flora
The Andean region cuts across several natural and floristc regions due to is large extension from Caribbean Venezuela to cold, windy and wet Horn passing trough hyperarid Desert. Rainforests used to encircle much of the northern Andes but are now greatly diminished, especially in the Choc and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. As a direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. Along with several Valles, they are typically dominated by deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric vegetation, reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Desert.

About 30,000 species of plants live in the Andes with roughly half being endemic to the region, surpassing the diversity of any other hotspot.( The small tree pubescens, a source of quinine which is used to treat malaria, is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that originated from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes. The high-altitude Polylepis forests and woodlands are found in the Andean areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees, by locals referred to as Queua, Yagual and other names, can be found at altitudes of  above sea level. It remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the Incan period. Regardless, in modern times the clearance has accelerated, and the trees are now considered to be highly endangered, with some believing that as little as 10% of the original woodland remains.()

Fauna
Image:Tunki Tanpupata.jpg|thumb|A male Cock-of-the-rock, a species found in humid Andean forests.
Image:Ausangate-hillside-MT.jpg|thumb|Herds of alpacas on the mountain Ausangate hillside.

The Andes is rich in fauna: With almost 3,500 species, of which roughly 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians.(Tropical Andes - biodiversityhotspots.org)
The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of mammals (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (about 1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of reptile (about 45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (about 1/3 endemic).(

The Vicua and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are widely kept by locals as animals and for their meat and wool. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, inhabit the Andes alpine regions. The Condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Hemisphere, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the huemul, cougar, foxes in the genus Pseudalopex, and, for birds, certain species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Goose, Coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes),  Rhea, Flicker, Sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches.

Titicaca hosts several endemics, among them the highly endangered Flightless Grebe and Water Frog. A few species of hummingbirds, notably some hillstars, can be seen at altitudes above , but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests (forests) growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the Yungas and parts of the Choc, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exists, exceptions being the threatened Tapir, Bear and Woolly Monkey.

Birds of humid Andean forests include mountain-toucans, quetzals and the Cock-of-the-rock, while species flocks dominated by tanagers and Furnariids commonly are seen - in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens, tapaculos and antpittas.

A number of species such as the Cinclodes and Tit-spinetail  are associated with Polylepis, and consequently also threatened.

Human activity


thumb|Map showing cultural influence in the Andes.

The Andes mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences. A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the civilization and Empire in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through imperialistic militarism as well as careful and meticulous governmental management.(DAltroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003) The government sponsored the construction of aqueducts and roads in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.

Devastated by European diseases to which they had no immunity, and civil wars, in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. Huancas, Chachapoyas, Caaris) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by Pizarro. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was Picchu, which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the Quechua and language families. Parish and Barclay Pentland surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.

In modern times, the largest Andean cities are Colombia, with a population of about eight million, Paz, Bolivia, and Ecuador.

Transportation
Image:Carretera transandina.jpg|thumb|Troncal 7 (Highway) in the Venezuelan Andes.

Several major cities exist either in the Andes or in the foothills, among which are Bogot and Colombia; Ecuador; Venezuela; Paz, Bolivia; Chile, and Peru. These and most other cities and large towns are now connected with asphalt-paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a four-wheel-drive vehicle.(

The rough terrain has historically put the costs of building highways and railroads that cross the Andes out of reach of most neighboring countries, even with modern engineering practices. For example, the main cross over the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the Internacional Los Libertadores, and only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected(). Much of the transportation of passengers is done via airline.

For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the of the Pacific between Chile, and the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Argentina out of the war. The Army and Navy defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivias only province on the Pacific Coast, and some land from Peru, also - that was returned to Peru later. Bolivia has been a landlocked country ever since then.

However, if Chile had kept some land to  the east, the difficulties in transportation between east and west would have been enormous. There has also been bad blood between Bolivia and Chile ever since 1870, and these two countries have not had diplomatic relations since about 1974.

Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in which  vehicles are of little use are still present. Locally, the relatives of the camel, the llama and the alpaca continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times.

Agriculture
thumb|Photograph of young Peruvian farmers sowing maize and beans.

The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practised irrigation techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, terracing has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The potato holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. Maize was also an important crop for these people. However, they were mainly used for the production of the culturally important chicha. Currently, tobacco, cotton and coffee are the main export crops. Coca, despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating tea, and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of cocaine.

Mining
The Andes rose to fame for its mineral wealth during the Spanish conquest of South America. Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals the mineralizations of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival. Potos in present-day Bolivia was one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World. de la Plata and Argentina derive their names from the silver of Potos.

Currently, mining in the Andes of Chile and Peru place these countries as the 1st and 3rd major producers of copper in the world. The Bolivian Andes produce principally tin although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the economy of 17th century Europe.

There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish silver mines in Potos in the 16th century to the vast current copper deposits of Chuquicamata and Escondida in Chile and Toquepala in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are also important.

Wood resin, the source of amber




Amber is fossilized tree resin (not sap), which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.( Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as jewelry. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams. (Poinar GO, Poinar R. The quest for life in amber. Basic Books, 1995, ISBN 0201489287, p. 133)

History and etymology
The English word amber derives from the Arabic anbar, via Medieval Latin ambar and Old French ambre. The word originally referred to a precious oil derived from the whale (now called ambergris). The sense was extended to fossil resin circa 1400, and this became the main sense as the use of ambergris waned.() The two substances were confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats; whereas amber is less dense than stone, but too dense to float.(see: Abu Zaid al Hassan from Siraf &amp; Sulaiman the Merchant (851), Silsilat-al-Tawarikh (travels in Asia).) The word ambar was brought to Europe by the Crusaders. In French ambre gris was then distinguished from ambre jaune: ambre gris (gray amber) was ambergris; ambre jaune (yellow amber) was the fossil resin we now call amber.

Amber is discussed by Theophrastus, possibly the first historical mention of the material, in the 4th century BC. The Greek name for amber was    (electron) and was connected to the Sun God, one of whose titles was Elector or the Awakener.() The modern terms electricity and electron derive from the Greek word for amber and come from William Gilberts research showing that amber could attract other substances.() The word electron was coined in 1891 by the Irish physicist George Stoney whilst analyzing elementary charges for the first time.()()

The presence of insects in amber was noticed by the Elder in his Historia, and led him to theorize correctly that, at some point, amber had to be in a liquid state to cover the bodies of insects. Hence he gave it the expressive name of succinum or gum-stone, a name that is still in use today to describe acid as well as succinite, a term given to a particular type of amber by Dwight Dana (see below under Baltic Amber).

Heating amber will soften it and eventually it will burn, which is why in languages the word for amber is a literal translation of burn-Stone (nl. barnsteen, de. Bernstein, the latter of which the Polish word bursztyn derives from). Heated above 200C, amber suffers decomposition, yielding an oil of amber, and leaving a black residue which is known as amber colophony, or amber pitch; when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in oil this forms amber varnish or amber lac. 

Amber from the Sea has been extensively traded since antiquity and in the main land, from where amber was traded 2000 years ago, the natives called it glaes (referring to its see-through similarity to glass). 

The Baltic Lithuanian term for amber is Gintaras and Latvian Dzintars. They and the Slavic jantar are thought to originate from Phoenician jainitar (sea-resin). However, while most Slavic languages, such as Russian and Czech, retain the old Slavic word, in the Polish language, despite still being correct, jantar is used very rarely (even considered archaic) and was replaced by the word bursztyn deriving from the German analogue.

Composition and formation
Amber is heterogeneous in composition, but consists of several resinous bodies more or less soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, associated with an insoluble bituminous substance. Amber is a macromolecule by free polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene.(Manuel Villanueva-Garca, Antonio Martnez-Richa, and Juvencio Robles Assignment of vibrational spectra of labdatriene derivatives and ambers: A combined experimental and density functional theoretical study Arkivoc (EJ-1567C) pp. 449458) These labdanes are diterpenes (C20H32) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization.

The average composition of amber leads to the general formula C10H16O.

Formation
Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into copal. Sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber.()

Botanical origin
Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the Agathis group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus Hymenaea,()
while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from Sciadopityaceae family plants that used to live in north Europe.()

Inclusions
The abnormal development of resin has been called succinosis. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped on to the ground, so that the material may be useless except for varnish-making, whence the impure amber is called firniss. Enclosures of pyrites may give a bluish color to amber. The so-called black amber is only a kind of jet. Bony amber owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin.

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution X-rays.()

Extraction and processing
 Distribution and mining 

Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.
Historically, the coast around Knigsberg in Prussia was the worlds leading source of amber. About 90% of the worlds extractable amber is still located in the Oblast of Russia on the Baltic Sea (which was previously Knigsberg in Prussia, before World War II).(Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast)

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of blue earth have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.

Dominican amber, especially Dominican blue amber, is mined through pitting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.(Wilfred Wichard und Wolfgang Weitschat: Im Bernsteinwald.  Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, 2004, ISBN 3-8067-2551-9)

Treatment

The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a lathe and polish it with whitening and water or with stone and oil. The final lustre is given by friction with flannel.

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of amberoid or pressed amber. The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure; the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri, as well as by celluloid and even glass. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called true amber.

Appearance
Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color amber, amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other more uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as cherry amber), green amber, and even amber, which is rare and highly sought after.

Much of the most highly-prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as bony amber.

Although all amber is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about 100 kg is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.()

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.

Classification
Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. Terpenoids, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of isoprene (C5H8) units.( Phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.( The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysisgas chromatographymass spectrometry.( The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.()( There is also a separate classifications of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.

Class I
This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids.( It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilise regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), whilst Ic uses enantio labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, enantio biformenes).()

Ia
Includes Succinite ( normal Baltic amber) and Glessite.( Have a communic acid base. They also include much succinic acid.(

amber yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.()

Ib
Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack acid.(

Ic
This class is mainly based on enantio-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and zanzibaric acids.( Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.(

Dominican amber differentiates itself from amber by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of fossil inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.(George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World, (Princeton University Press) ISBN 0-691-02888-5) Resin from the extinct species protera is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not succinite but retinite.(Grimaldi, D. A.: Amber  Window to the Past.  American Museum of Natural History, New York 1996)

Class II
These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as cadinene.(

Class III
These ambers are polystyrenes.(

Class IV
This class is something of a wastebasket; its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of cedrane-based sesquiterpenoids.(

Class V
Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and n-alkyl compounds. Their type mineral is highgate copalite.()

Classification of Baltic amber (succinite) gemstones by the International Amber Association

*Natural Baltic amber  gemstone which has undergone mechanical treatment only (for instance: grinding, cutting, turning or polishing) without any change to its natural properties

*Modified Baltic amber  gemstone subjected only to thermal or high-pressure treatment, which changed its physical properties, including the degree of transparency and color, or shaped under similar conditions out of one nugget, previously cut to the required size.

*Reconstructed (pressed) Baltic amber  gemstone made of Baltic amber pieces pressed in high temperature and under high pressure without additional components.

*Bonded Baltic amber  gemstone consisting of two or more parts of natural, modified or reconstructed Baltic amber bonded together with the use of the smallest possible amount of a colorless binding agent necessary to join the pieces.

Geological record
The oldest amber recovered dates to the Upper Carboniferous period ().()() Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers  it is most similar to the resins produced by plants.(There are no flowering plant fossils until the Cretaceous, and they were not common until the Cretaceous.) Amber becomes abundant long afterwards, in the Cretaceous, ,( when it is found in association with insects. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Middle East from Lebanon and Jordan (Kaddumi, 2007; Azar, 2000). This amber is roughly 133 million years old and is considered of high scientific value. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan (Kaddumi, 2007) including the oldest zorapterans, clerid beetles, umenocoleid roaches, and achiliid planthoppers.

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber) is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand, known as blue earth, occurring in the Lower Oligocene strata of Samland in Prussia (Latin: Sambia), in historical sources also referred to as Glaesaria. After 1945 this territory around Knigsberg was turned into Oblast, Russia, where it is now systematically mined.() It appears, however, to have been partly derived from yet earlier Tertiary deposits (Eocene); and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as drift. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern Asia and the southern part of America. Gppert named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests Pinites succiniter, but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called Pinus succinifera. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.

Paleontological significance
Amber is a unique preservational mode, preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems and organisms.(BBC  Radio 4  Amber. Db.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.)

The chemical composition of the resin is, unfortunately, of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer.(

Amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted. Insects, spiders and their webs, annelids, frogs,() crustaceans, bacteria and amoebae,() marine microfossils,() wood, flowers and fruit, hair, feathers and other small organisms have been recovered in ambers dating to .(

Use
Amber has been used since antiquity in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments, and also in medicine. Amber also forms the flavoring for akvavit liquor. Amber has been used as an ingredient in perfumes.

Jewelry
Amber has been used since the stone age, from 13,000 years ago.( Amber ornaments have been found in Mycenaean tombs and elsewhere across Europe. To this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces.()() Ambers place in culture and tradition lends it a tourism value; Amber Museum is dedicated to the mineral.

Historic medicinal uses
Amber has long been used in medicine for its purported healing properties. Amber and extracts were used from the time of Hippocrates in ancient Greece for a wide variety of treatments through the Ages and up until the early twentieth century.

Scent of amber and amber perfumery
In ancient China it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, of amber is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with acid to create artificial musk  a resin with a peculiar musky odor.(Amber as an aphrodisiac) Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic pinewood fragrance, modern products, such as perfume, do not normally use actual amber. This is due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as amber are often created and patented(Saturated indane derivatives and processes for producing same, Ernst T. Thermer, p. 1 , , issue date 1972)(Perfume compositions and perfume articles containing one isomer of an octahydrotetramethyl acetonaphthone, John B. Hall, Rumson; James Milton Sanders, Eatontown , Publication Date: 30 December 1975)
to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil.(Sorcery of Scent: Amber: A perfume myth. Sorceryofscent.blogspot.com (2008-07-30). Retrieved on 2011-04-23.) The modern name for amber is thought to come from the Arabic word, ambar, meaning ambergris.( Ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of sperm whales and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern. The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and/or labdanum but due to the endangered status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum.() The term amber is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

Amber perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum, resin, copal (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), vanilla, resin and/or synthetic materials.(

Acacia ( or ) is a genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae, first described in Africa by the Swedish botanist Linnaeus in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian acacias are not. They are pod-bearing, with sap and leaves typically bearing large amounts of tannins and tannins that historically in many species found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.

The generic name derives from  (akakia), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician Dioscorides (ca. 40-90) to the medicinal tree A. nilotica in his book Materia Medica.() This name derives from the Greek word for its characteristic thorns,  (akis, thorn).() The species name nilotica was given by Linnaeus from this trees best-known range along the Nile river.

Acacias are also known as thorntrees, thorns or wattles, including the yellow-fever acacia and umbrella acacias.

The genus Acacia previously contained roughly 1300 species, about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-temperate regions of both hemispheres, including Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and the Americas. However, in 2005 the genus was divided into five separate genera. The name Acacia was retained for the majority of the Australian species and a few in tropical Asia, Madagascar and Islands. Most of the species outside Australia, and a small number of Australian species, were reclassified into Vachellia and Senegalia. The two final genera, Acaciella and Mariosousa, only contain about a dozen species from the Americas each.

The traditional circumscription of the genus Acacia is not monophyletic. This discovery has led to the breaking up of Acacia into five genera as discussed in: of Acacia species. At the 17th Botanical Congress in Vienna, 2005, the much debated re-typification of the genus with an Australian species (which was validated by the 18th IBC in Melbourne, 2011) most of the traditional acacias of Africa are now treated in the genera Vachellia and Senegalia, while some of the American species are placed in Acaciella and Mariosousa. The majority of species still treated in the genus Acacia are confined to Australia.
In common parlance, the term acacia is occasionally misapplied to species of the genus Robinia, which also belongs in the pea family. pseudoacacia, an American species locally known as Black Locust, is sometimes called false acacia in cultivation in the Kingdom.

 Geography 
The southernmost species in the genus are dealbata (Silver Wattle), longifolia (Coast Wattle or Sydney Golden Wattle), mearnsii (Black Wattle), and melanoxylon (Blackwood), reaching 4330 S in Tasmania, Australia, while caven (Espinillo Negro) reaches nearly as far south in northeastern Province of Argentina. Australian species are usually called wattles, while African and American species tend to be known as acacias.

File:Acacia melanoxylon2.jpg|thumb|left|retinodes

albida, tortilis and Acacia iraqensis can be found growing wild in the Sinai desert and the Jordan valley. It is found in the savanna vegetation of the tropical continental climate. It grows wild in Montserrat West Indies; there it is locally referred to as cusha.

 Description 
The leaves of acacias are compound pinnate in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and islands species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks (petioles) become vertically flattened, and serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as phyllodes. The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight, as with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light so fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as glaucoptera) lack leaves or phyllodes altogether, but possess instead cladodes, modified leaf-like photosynthetic stems functioning as leaves.

The small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long stamens, and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, even purple (Acacia purpureapetala) or red (leprosa Scarlet Blaze). Acacia flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, Albizia,  by their stamens which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual Mimosa flowers, those of Acacia have more than 10 stamens.()

The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches which have become short, hard and pungent, or sometimes leaf-stipules. armata is the Kangaroo-thorn of Australia and erioloba is the Camelthorn of Africa.

Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80 C) and manual seed coat chipping can improve yields to approximately 80 percent.()

Symbiosis
File:Acacia collinsii3.jpg|thumb|right|collinsii stipules
In the American sphaerocephala, cornigera, and collinsii (collectively known as the bullthorn acacias), the large thorn-like stipules are hollow and afford shelter for several species of Pseudomyrmex ants, which feed on a secretion of sap on the leaf-stalk and small, lipid-rich food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets called Beltian bodies. In return, the ants add protection to the plant against herbivores.(

)  Some species of ants will also fight off competing plants around the acacia, cutting off the offending plants leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing it. Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts.

Similar mutualisms with ants occur on Acacia trees in Africa, such as the Thorn acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in the hollow stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants such as mimosae. In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles that damage the plant.

 Pests 
In Australia, Acacia species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus including A. ligniveren. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other Lepidoptera larvae which have been recorded feeding on Acacia include Brown-tail, Endoclita malabaricus and Moth. The leaf-mining larvae of some bucculatricid moths also feed on Acacia: Bucculatrix agilis feeds exclusively on horrida and Bucculatrix flexuosa feeds exclusively on nilotica.

Acacias contain a number of compounds that defend them from pests and grazing animals.(Chemistry of Acacias from South Texas)

 Uses 
 Food uses 
File:Hauxya Botana.jpg|thumb|Acacia seed pods, also known as Guajes, served as part of a botana in Oaxaca, Mexico.
File:AcaciaSeeds.JPG|thumb|Acacia seeds in the Negev, Israel.
seeds are often used for food and a variety of other products.

In Burma, Laos and Thailand, the feathery shoots of Acacia pennata (common name cha-om,  and su pout ywet in Burmese) are used in soups, curries, omelettes, and stir-fries.

In Mexico the seeds are known as Guajes.  Guajes or huajes are the flat, green pods of an acacia tree. The pods are sometimes light green or deep red in colorboth taste the same. Guaje seeds are about the size of a small lima bean and are eaten raw with guacamole, sometimes cooked and made into a sauce. They can also be made into fritters. The ground seeds are used to impart a slightly garlicy flavor to a mole called guaxmole (huaxmole). The dried seeds may be toasted and salted and eaten as a snack referred to as cacalas.

The predominantly herbivorous spider kiplingi, which is found in Central America and Mexico, feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves, known as Beltian bodies, which contain high concentrations of protein.  These nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ant, which also eat them.(Meehan, Christopher J.; Olson, Eric J.; Curry, Robert L. (21 August 2008): Exploitation of the PseudomyrmexAcacia mutualism by a predominantly vegetarian jumping spider (Bagheera kiplingi). The 93rd ESA Annual Meeting.)

Acacia is listed as an ingredient in Drop, Fresca, a citrus drink, Cola, Barqs beer, Full Throttle Unleaded Drink, Strawberry-Lemonade Powerade(Powerade Ion4 Sports Drink, B Vitamin Enhanced, Strawberry Lemonade | Wegmans) as well as in Lkerol pastille candies, Altoids mints, Langers Pineapple coconut Juice, Wrigleys Eclipse gum and M&amp;Ms Pretzel.

Honey labeled under the term Acacia Honey is a type of honey produced by bees from a false acacia known as locust in North America, but called by the misnomer  acacia in Europe, hence this liquid honey which practically doesnt crystallize does not come from true acacias.

Gum
Various species of acacia yield gum. True arabic is the product of senegal, abundant in dry tropical West Africa from Senegal to northern Nigeria.

arabica is the gum-Arabic tree of India, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.

Medicinal uses
Many Acacia species have important uses in traditional medicine. Most of the uses have been shown to have a scientific basis since chemical compounds found in the various species have medicinal effects.

In medicine, nilotica is considered a remedy that is helpful for treating ejaculation.
A 19th century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an Ethiopian species of Acacia (known as grar) mixed with the root of the tacha, then boiled, as a cure for rabies.(Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), p. 97)

An astringent medicine high in tannins, called catechu or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from catechu, by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.(An OCRd version of the US Dispensatory by Remington and Wood, 1918. )

Ornamental uses
A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens; the most popular perhaps is dealbata (Silver Wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as mimosa in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus Mimosa.

Another ornamental acacia is xanthophloea (Fever Tree).
Southern European florists use Acacia baileyana, Acacia dealbata, Acacia pycnantha and Acacia retinodes as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa.(World Wide Wattle)

Ornamental species of acacia are also used by homeowners and architects for security. The sharp thorns of some species deter unauthorized persons from entering private properties, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a considerable alternative to artificial fences and walls.

Paints
The ancient Egyptians used Acacia in paints.(Excerpt from A Consumers Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Fifth Edition (Paperback) Amazon.com)

Perfume
File:Acaciafarnesiana1web.jpg|thumb|left|farnesiana
farnesiana is used in the perfume industry due to its strong fragrance. The use of Acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries.

Symbolism and ritual
The Acacia is used as a symbol in Freemasonry, to represent purity and endurance of the soul, and as funerary symbolism signifying resurrection and immortality. The tree gains its importance from the description of the burial of Abiff, the builder of King Solomons Temple in Jerusalem.

Several parts (mainly bark, root and resin) of Acacia are used to make incense for rituals. Acacia is used in incense mainly in India, Nepal, and China including in its Tibet region. Smoke from Acacia bark is thought to keep demons and ghosts away and to put the gods in a good mood. Roots and resin from Acacia are combined with rhododendron, acorus, cytisus, salvia and some other components of incense. Both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit.(Naturheilpraxis Fachforum (German) )
According to Eastons Bible Dictionary, the Acacia tree may be the burning bush (Exodus 3:2) which Moses encountered in the desert.(Eastons Bible Dictionary: Bush)  Also, when God gave Moses the instructions for building the Tabernacle, he said to make an ark  and a table of acacia wood (Exodus 25:10 &amp; 23, Standard Version)

In Russia, Italy and other countries it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas (among other flowers) on Womens Day (March 8). These mimosas are actually from dealbata (Silver Wattle).

Tannin
File:Bottle of tannic acid.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of acid.
The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in tannin and forms an important article of export; important species include pycnantha (Golden Wattle), decurrens (Tan Wattle), dealbata (Silver Wattle) and mearnsii (Black Wattle).

Black Wattle is grown in plantations in Africa. Most Australian acacia species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation. The pods of nilotica (under the name of neb-neb), and of other African species are also rich in tannin and used by tanners.

Wood
File:Starr 030405-0092 Acacia koa.jpg||thumb|right|koa Wood
File:Acacia Negev.JPG|thumb|right|Acacia tree near the end of its range in the Negev Desert of southern Israel.
Some Acacia species are valuable as timber, such as melanoxylon (Blackwood) from Australia, which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and Acacia omalophylla (Myall Wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. seyal is thought to be the Shittah-tree of the Bible, which supplied shittim-wood. According to the of Exodus, this was used in the construction of the of the Covenant. Acacia koa from the Islands and heterophylla from Runion island are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some Acacia species (e.g. Acacia fumosa), are traditionally used locally as firewoods.()



Pulpwood
In Indonesia (mainly in Sumatra) and in Malaysia (mainly in Sarawak) plantations of mangium are being established to supply pulpwood to the paper industry.

Acacia gives high opacity and below average bulk paper. This is suitable in lightweight offset papers used for bibles and dictionaries. It is also used in tissue where it improves softness.

Land Reclamation
Acacia can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage.()

 Ecological invasion 
For the same reasons it is favored as an erosion-control plant, with its easy spreading and resilience, some varieties of acacia, are potentially an invasive species.  One of the most globally significant invasive Acacias is Black Wattle mearnsii,  which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread.  Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a high risk, score of 15 rating and it is considered one of the worlds 100 most invasive species.(Acacia mearnsii (PIER species info))
Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties as this fast-growing Genus, once introduced, spreads fast and is extremely difficult to eradicate.

Phytochemistry of Acacia
Alkaloids


As mentioned previously, Acacias contain a number of compounds that defend them from pests and grazing animals.( Many of these compounds are psychoactive in humans.
The alkaloids found in Acacias include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and N-methyltryptamine (NMT). The plant leaves, stems and/or roots are sometimes made into a brew together with some MAOI-containing plant and consumed orally for healing, ceremonial or religious uses. mythology has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the of life (see the article on the of Osiris and Isis).

Cyanogenic glycosides
Nineteen different species of Acacia in the Americas contain cyanogenic glycosides, which, if exposed to an enzyme which specifically splits glycosides, can release cyanide (HCN) in the acacia leaves.(Cyanogenic Glycosides in Ant-Acacias of Mexico and Central America David S. Seigler, John E. Ebinger The Southwestern Naturalist, Vol. 32, No. 4 (December 9, 1987), pp. 499-503 doi:10.2307/3671484) This sometimes results in the poisoning death of livestock.

If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 mol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia leaves lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.(Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer)

Some Acacia species containing cyanogens:
* erioloba
* Acacia cunninghamii
* Acacia obtusifolia
* Acacia sieberiana
* Acacia sieberiana var. woodii(FAO Kamal M. Ibrahim, The current state of knowledge on Prosopis juliflora... )

 Species 
There are over 1,300 species of Acacia. See of Acacia species for a more complete listing.

Famous acacia
Perhaps the most famous acacia is the du Tnr in Niger. The reason for the trees fame is that it used to be the most isolated tree in the world, approximately  from any other tree. The tree was knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.

Acapulco (officially known as Acapulco de Jurez) is a city, municipality and major sea port in the state of Guerrero on the Pacific coast of Mexico,  southwest from City. Acapulco is located on a deep, semi-circular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexicos history.()  It is a port of call for shipping and cruising lines running between Panama and Francisco, California, States.() The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital Chilpancingo and as well, Mexicos largest beach and balneario resorted city.()

The city is best known as one of Mexicos oldest and most well-known beach resorts, which came into prominence by the 1950s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires.()  Acapulco is still famous for its nightlife and still attracts many vacationers, although most are now from Mexico itself.()() The resort area is divided into two: The north end of the bay is the traditional area, where the famous in the mid 20th century vacationed and the south end is dominated by newer luxury high rise hotels.()

The name Acapulco comes from Nahuatl language Aca-pl-co, and means At the big reeds ()  or At the broken reeds.  de Jurez was added to the official name in 1885 to honor Jurez, the former of Mexico. The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane.(

History
By the eighth century, there was a small culture in the Acapulco area, which would first be dominated by the Olmecs, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period. In Acapulco bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by Playa Larga and the other on a hill known as El Guitarrn. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers. Later, Teotihuacan influence made its way here via Cuernavaca and Chilpancingo. Then Mayan influence arrived from the of Tehuantepec and through what is now Oaxaca. This history is known through the archeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta and Tambuco.(
In the 11th century, new waves of migration of Nahuas and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the Aztecs.  Acapulco formally became part of the Empire in 1486 during the reign of Ahuizotl. It was part of a tributary province called Tepecuacuilco, but control here was relatively unorganized.(


There are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the Conquest, Corts sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cern was authorized by Corts to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on 13 December 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.(
The first encomendero was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably Rodriguez de Villafuerte, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hernn Corts was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.(

Corts established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqus, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an alcadia (major province or town).(

Spanish trade in the East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of Spain. Galleons started arriving here from Asia by 1550, and in that year  thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents.( Acapulco would become the second most important port, after Veracruz, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly Galleon, which was the nexus of all kinds on communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.(

File:Carl Saltzmann - View of Acapulco, 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|View of Acapulco, 1879, oil painting by Saltzmann
The Galleon would make its yearly run from the mid 16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch pirates,  such as  Drake, Morgan and Cavendish, who called it The Black Ship.(( To protect the port and the cargo of ships coming here the San Diego Fort was built. Despite the forts existence, a Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town and fort before being driven off. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt in 1783.((
At the beginning of the 19th Century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, soon after the War of Independence began.  In 1810, Mara Morelos y Pavn attacked and burnt down the city,( after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Pars at the Battle of Tres Palos.( The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.(
Acapulcos importance as a port recovered during the Gold Rush in the mid 19th century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here.(

In 1911, revolutionary forces took over the main plaza of Acapulco.(
In 1920, the of Wales and future King Edward VIII visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an East Texas businessman named Albert B.Pullen from Corrigan, Tx. in the area now known as Old Acapulco.( But some of Acapulcos best known hotels were built by others.  In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador,(Portal de Acapulco - Acapulco y su Arquitectura) with 12 rooms on the cliffs of La Quebrada. Wolf Shoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Al Polin built the Las Americas Hotel.(

In the mid 1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses has been built.( In the early 1950s President Alemn Valds upgraded the ports infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.(


The economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaires Hollywood stars such as Taylor, Sinatra, Eddie Fisher and Bardot.( Former Swing Musician Stauffer, so called Mister Acapulco, was a hotelowner (Villa Vera, Casablanca), who attracted a lot of celebrities to Acapulco.(Teddy Stauffer: Der Swingknig im Paradies - STOCKPRESS.de | STOCKPRESS.de)

From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s,( by the early 1960s Acapulco had a population of about 50,000.(World Book Encyclopedia, 1967 Edition, Vol. 1, p. 19) In 1958, The Diocese of Acapulco was created by Pius XII. It would become an archdiocese in 1983.()

During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco, the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here.( However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur.()


In the 70s there was a significant expansion of the port.(

During the 1990s, the road known as the Ruta del Sol was built, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey only takes about three and a half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants.( The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.(

The city was devastated by Pauline in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the shantytowns that surround the city, built on steep hillsides. Other victims were swept away by thirty foot waves and  winds. The main road, Avenida Costera became a fast-moving three foot river of sludge.()

In the 2000s, the drug war in Mexico has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006. A major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers.(() This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back.( However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before.() The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel. () Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010 and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011.  Among the first incidents dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor.(Mexico: Guerrero narco-violence breaks grisly record | World War 4 Report) In the second incident the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Senderos shopping center.() On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the citys main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces. ()

Geography and climate

Tourism

Acapulco is one of Mexicos oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale.() But nowadays, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with local corrupt police who steal money by extortion, and intimidate visitors with threats to jail.()()() The original Acapulco, where hotels owned by personalities such as Weismuller and Wayne are located, is on the northern end of the bay. This is where the boardwalk and main square are and today the area is filled with modern, Mexican style hotels, with discothques and restaurants in walking distance.( This side of the bay is also known as Tradicional or Nautica.

The south end of the bay holds the newer constructions, including the high rise hotels. This area includes Punta Diamante, Puerto Marqus, and stretches from the airport to the Papagayo River which separates it from the older section of town. In this area, no one walks as almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart.(( The older section of town now mostly caters to middle class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to international visitors and the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.(( This area also has the higher hotel occupancy rates.((

Acapulcos reputation is that of a high-energy party town, where one can have dinner at midnight, dance until dawn then relax in the daytime on the beach crowded with sexy bodies in bikinis. The nightlife has made this place famous for decades.( From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the Queen Victoria, the Rotterdam, Harmony as well as all the Princess liner ships.( Despite its international fame, most of Acapulcos visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City.((
Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line Star Cruises.(Ocean Star Cruises - Acapulco, Retrieved 05 August 2011.)

For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals adding 785 million pesos to the economy.  Eighty percent arrive by land and 18 percent by air.()  The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners.( Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and wealthy, such as Miguel, Plcido Domingo and Olmedo, who maintain homes here.(


While much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a pass resort, eclipsed by the newer Cancn and San Lucas.( Over the years a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches such as Tamarindos, who offer everything from newspapers to massages are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach but the government says is difficult to eradicate as there is a lot of unemployment and poor here.()  Around the city are many shantytowns that cling onto the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. Prostitution is also common here as well.( In the last decade, drug related violence has caused problems for the tourism trade here.(

Another problem is garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash that is cleaned up during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires.()

Attractions
Acapulcos main attraction is its nightlife, and has been for many decades.(()  Nightclubs change names and owners frequently. Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is also a jump in this area as well.

Another enigmatic attraction at Acapulco are the Quebrada Cliff Divers.( The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive.()  Today the divers are professionals,( diving from heights of forty meters into an inlet that is only seven meters wide and four meters deep, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe.( On 12 December, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives ranges from the simple to the complicated and end with the Ocean of Fire when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for.( The spectacle can be seen from a public area, which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.()

There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarrn, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqus there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.()

In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, a small zoo and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers that died here. Many of the scuba diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations.() Another popular activity is deep sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. Sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything the trip is free.((

In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Zcalo with shade trees and lined with cafes and shops. At the north end of the Nuestra Seora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but when was later adapted into a church.( Acapulcos most historic building is the San Diego Fort, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from pirate attacks.( The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid 17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements.()()  Today the fort serves as the Museo Histrico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the ports history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are also temporary exhibits as well.(


The Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantial or CICI is a sea life and aquatic  park located on Costera Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children.(( Another place popular with children is the Parque Papagayo which is a large family park which has life-sized replicas of a Spanish galleon and the space shuttle Columbia, three artificial lakes, aviary, skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.(

The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by Rivera that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals are able to be seen by the public.(

There is a small museum called Casa de la Mscara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and are divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The Huichols and the Jaguar, Alebrijes and Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.(
The Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pacifico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many are in danger of extinction, such as the mexicana or purple stick tree.(

The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and gourmet food fair. The Cinpolis Galeras Diana and the Teatro Juan Ruz de Alarcn show French and French literary figures give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs will feature French DJs.()  Other festivals celebrated here include  Carnival, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May and a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China in November.(

There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqus course, the latter designed by Trent Jones in 1972 for the World Cup Golf Tournament. The Mayan Palace course was designed by Guericia and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center.  The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by von Hagge. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.(

Acapulco also has a bullring, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.(



Spring break
Over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and balnearios throughout Mexico over break each year.() The main reason students head to Mexico is the 18 year old drinking age (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as Beach, Florida have become restrictive on drinking and other behaviors. This has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.()


In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cancn had been favored at the spring break destination of choice. However, Cancun has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This has led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that the flight is longer and more expensive than to Cancun for many travelers. Many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulcos famous nightlife.() In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, mostly due to the economic situation in the United States,() and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.() MTV will transmit special programming from Acapulco in 2010.()

In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco.(http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_3028.html ) The warninga result of violent activity springing from Mexicos drug cartel debacletook college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break.  The New York Times tracked the travels of another Penn student on spring break in Acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email, while Bill OReilly devoted a segment of his show, OReilly Factor, to urge students to stay away from Acapulco.()  In June 2009 a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets involving large-caliber weapons and grenades.()  However, no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported.

Transportation

From the U.S., many airlines now fly to Acapulco Airport year-round. While in the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized Colectivo cab system. These cabs cost 10 pesos per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first come first served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs mainly travel to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, which is where most of the hotels for visitors are, but also includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly up to his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.

The bus system is highly complex, and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form other than walking in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco! painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decaling and home made interior designs that range from book scenes, to adult themes, and even to Kitty themes.
