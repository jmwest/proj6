Botswana
 footnotes                Botswana, officially the Republic of Botswana (), is a country located in Africa. The citizens are referred to as Batswana (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. It has held free and fair democratic elections since independence.Botswana is flat, and up to 70% is covered by the Desert. It is bordered by Africa to the south and southeast, Namibia to the west and north, and Zimbabwe to the northeast. Its border with Zambia to the north is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred meters long. (Zambia-Botswana border)A mid-sized, landlocked country of just over two million people, Botswana is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa when it gained independence from Britain in 1966, with a GDP per capita of about US$70. Botswana has transformed itself, becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world to a GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $14,800 (2010 IMF estimate). The country also has a strong tradition as a democracy.HistoryImage:Gaboronecitycentre.JPG|thumb|left|City centre buildings in Gaborone, Botswanathumb|left|A traditional dwellingIn the 19th century, hostilities broke out between Tswana inhabitants of Botswana and Ndebele tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the Boer settlers from the Transvaal to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders III, Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government put Bechuanaland under its protection on 31 March 1885. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the Colony and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of Setswana-speaking people today live in South Africa.When the of South Africa was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Swaziland (the High Commission Territories) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, Britain kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the Nationalist government in 1948, which instituted apartheid, and South Africas withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa.An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.In June 1964, Britain accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from Mafikeng in South Africa, to the newly established Gaborone, which sits near its border. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. Khama, a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the Ngwato chiefship, was elected as the first president, re-elected twice.The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, Masire, who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, Mogae, who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to Khama (son of the first president), who resigned his position as leader of the Defence Force to take up this civilian role.A long-running dispute over the northern border with Namibias Strip was the subject of a ruling by the Court of Justice in December 1999, which ruled that Island belongs to Botswana.()Politics and governmentThe politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a representative democratic republic, whereby the of Botswana is both of state and of government, and of a system. power is exercised by the government. power is vested in both the government and the of Botswana. The most recent election, its tenth, was held on 16 October 2009.Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the Democratic Party. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. According to International, Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks similarly close to Portugal and South Korea.(Transparency International 2008 Corruption Perception Index 2008. Retrieved 7-23-09.) The national anthem is leno la rona.Administrative divisionsBotswana is divided into 16 districts  10 rural districts and 6 urban districts.#Central District#District#District#District#District#North-East District#Ngamiland District#South-East District#Southern District#DistrictGeography and environmentFile:Flying-female-Lechwe.jpg|thumb|A lechwe in the DeltaAt  Botswana is the worlds 47th-largest country (after Ukraine). It is comparable in size to Madagascar, and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Texas or the Canadian province of Manitoba. It lies between latitudes 17 and 27S, and longitudes 20 and 30E.The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling tableland. Botswana is dominated by the Desert, which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The Delta, the worlds largest inland delta, is in the northwest. The Pan, a large salt pan, lies in the north.The River Basin, the major landform of all of Africa, lies partly in Botswana, in the southeast of the country. The Chobe River lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia (Caprivi Region). The Chobe River meets with the Zambezi River at a place called Kazungula (meaning a small sausage tree, a point where Sebitwane and his Makololo tribe crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are grasslands and savannas, where Wildebeest, antelopes, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered Wild Dog. National Park, found in the District, has the worlds largest concentration of elephants. The park covers about  and supports about 350 species of birds.thumb|left|Sunrise in BotswanaThe Chobe National Park and Game Reserve (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the Kalahari Game Reserve located in the Kalahari desert in District; Pans National Park and Pan National Park are in Central District in the Pan. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the River and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is Nature Reserve near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the Khama Rhino Sanctuary (for Rhinoceros) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for Flamingos). They are both located in Central District.Environmental problemsImage:Moremi gorge 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moremi Gorge, in the Tswapong Hills east of Palapye, Botswana. The porous rock absorbs rainwater, which then seeps out forming permanent cascades and pools. The hills provide one of Botswanas two breeding sites for the endangered vulture.thumb|Tourists at Chobe National ParkImage:Baobob tree.jpg|thumb|upright|A tree (Adansonia digitata)Botswana is currently facing two major environmental problems: drought and desertification.  The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country.  Due to the drought, 75% of the countrys human and animal populations are dependent on groundwater.  Groundwater use has eased the effects of drought, but has left a toll on the land. Groundwater is retrieved through drilling deep boreholes, which leads to the erosion of the land.  Surface water is very scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall.  Due to this 95% of the country raises cattle and livestock as a means for an income.  Therefore, it is not a surprise to see that 71% of the countrys land is used for communal grazing, which has been a major cause for the desertification of the country.()Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land is continuing to be exploited. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million(.  Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase.  Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is presently the largest single source of rural income.  Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use.  Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change.(  It has been reported that the Delta is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.() The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana, the largest inland delta in the world and is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.(The Department and Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti.() Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The States Government has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswanas debt by $8.3 million US dollars.  The stipulation of the US reducing Botswanas debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive conservation of the land.(The Nations Development Programme claims that a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources, including land, in Botswana, is due to the poverty level.  To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana.  The purpose of the project is to draw from indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems.  The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, in order to draw these in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty.  The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development()DefenceAt the time of independence, Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after attacks from the Rhodesian and South African armies that the Defence Force (BDF) was formed in self-defence in 1977. The president is commander in chief and appoints a defence council. The BDF has approximately 12,000 members.Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDFs missions have increasingly focused on prevention of poaching, preparing for disasters, and foreign peacekeeping. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps has received U.S. training. It is considered an apolitical and professional institution.EconomyFile:Mochudi.jpg|thumb|Mochudi, one of the larger villages in Botswanathumb|An aerial view over Gaborone, BotswanaImage:Debswana HQ.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of Debswana Diamond Company Ltd in Gaborone, BotswanaSince independence, Botswana has had one of the fastest growth rates in capita income in the world.(US Department of State website, Background Note: Botswana, May 2009. Retrieved 7-23-09.) Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest national income at power parity in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of Mexico and Turkey.()According to the Monetary Fund, growth averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Botswana has a high level of economic freedom compared to other African countries.() The government has maintained a sound policy, despite consecutive budget deficits in 2002 and 2003, and a negligible level of foreign debt. It earned the highest sovereign rating in Africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves (over $7 billion in 2005/2006) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports.Debswana, the largest diamond mining company operating in Botswana, is 50% owned by the government.() Mineral industry provides about 40% of all government revenues.() In 2007, significant quantities of uranium were discovered, and mining is projected to begin by 2010. Several international mining corporations have established regional headquarters in Botswana, and prospected for diamonds, gold, uranium, copper, and even oil, many coming back with positive results. Government announced in early 2009, that they would try and shift their economic dependence on diamonds, over serious concern that diamonds are predicted to dry out in Botswana over the next twenty years.thumb|350px|Botswanas trading partners in 2004. Source: CIA World Factbook.An array of financial institutions populates the countrys financial system, with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size. Banks remain profitable, well-capitalized, and liquid, as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates.()Botswanas competitive banking system is one of Africas most advanced. Generally adhering to global standards in the transparency of financial policies and banking supervision, the financial sector provides ample access to credit for entrepreneurs. The opening of Capital Bank in 2008 brought the total number of licensed banks to eight. The government is involved in banking through state-owned financial institutions and a special financial incentives program that is aimed at increasing Botswanas status as a financial centre. Credit is allocated on market terms, although the government provides subsidized loans. Reform of non-bank financial institutions has continued in recent years, notably through the establishment of a single financial regulatory agency that provides more effective supervision. The government has abolished exchange controls, and with the resulting creation of new portfolio investment options, the Botswana Stock Exchange is growing.The constitution prohibits the nationalization of private property and provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2009 International Property Rights Index.While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves a number of sectors for citizen participation. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchises fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.DemographicsFile:Gathering food in the Okavango.jpg|thumb|A girl in the Delta.Botswanas main ethnic groups are Batswana, BaKalanga, Bushmen or AbaThwa also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are Bayei, Bambukushu, Basubia, Baherero and Bakgalagadi. Other groups of ethnicities in Botswana include whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. Botswanas Indian population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, South Africa, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The white population is native to Botswana or from other parts of Africa including Zimbabwe and South Africa. The white population speaks either English or Afrikaans and makes up roughly 3% of the population.Since 2000, because of deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, the number of in Botswana has risen into the tens of thousands.()Fewer than 10,000 Bushmen are still living the traditional hunter-gatherer style of life. Since the mid-1990s the central government of Botswana has been trying to move San out of their lands.(African Bushmen Tour U.S. to Fund Fight for Land. National Geographic News.) The UNs top official on rights, Prof. Anaya, has condemned Botswanas persecution of the Bushmen in a report released in February 2010.()()LanguageImage:Khutse Kalahari Lodge.jpg|thumb|A rondavel at Khutse Kalahari Lodge, Botswana.The official language of Botswana is English although Setswana is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana prefixes are more important than they are in many other languages. These prefixes include Bo, which refers to the country, Ba, which refers to the people, Mo, which is one person, and Se which is the language. For example, the main tribe of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.ReligionbarsAn estimated 70 percent of the countrys citizens identify themselves as Christians. Anglicans, Methodists, and the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa make up the majority of Christians. There are also congregations of Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Baptists, the Dutch Reformed Church, Mennonites, Mormons, Jehovahs Witnesses, and other Christian sects.According to the 2001 census, the countrys Muslim community, primarily of South Asian origin, numbers slightly more than 5,000. The 2001 census also lists approximately 3,000 Hindus and 700 Bahais. Approximately 20 percent of citizens espouse no religion. Religious services are well attended in both rural and urban areas.()Healthexpectancy at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002.()HIV/AIDSLike elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the impact of AIDS is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 20023 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. Botswana has been hit very hard by the pandemic; in 2006 it was estimated that expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.()The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana was estimated at 24% for adults in 2006.() In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic anti-retroviral drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus.  The promiscuous nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation; so much so that it has given rise to a Love Vocabulary() that is unique to the region.Approximately one in six Batswana has HIV, giving Botswana the second highest infection rate in the world after nearby Swaziland.() The government recognizes that AIDS will affect the economy and is trying to combat the epidemic, including free anti-retroviral drug treatment and a nation-wide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program. Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%.CancerThe Association of Botswana is a voluntary organization. The association is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control. The Association supplements existing services through provision of cancer prevention and health awareness programmes, facilitating access to health services for cancer patients and offering support and counseling to those affected.()EducationImage:University of Botswana dorms.jpg|thumb|Residence hall of the of Botswana in Gaborone, BotswanaBotswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.()With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.After leaving school, students can attend one of the six technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in teaching or nursing. The best students enter the of Botswana, College of Agriculture http://www.bca.bw, and The Accountancy College in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. A high majority of these students are government sponsored. A larger influx of tertiary students is expected when construction of the nations second international university, The International University of Science and Technology, is completed in Palapye.One notable International University is University of Creative Technology that offers various Degree(s) in Arts. This has helped many youths develop and create their own businesses across the country.The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. The Botswana Ministry of Education() is working to establish libraries in primary schools in partnership with the Library Project.() The of Botswana hopes that by investing a large part of national income in education, the country will become less dependent on diamonds for its economic survival, and less dependent on expatriates for its skilled workers. Botswana invests 21% of its government spending in education.(In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education(BBC News website, Botswana brings back school fees. Retrieved 2009-23-7.) though the government still provides full scholarships with living expenses to any Botswana citizen in university, either at the University of Botswana or if the student wishes to pursue an education in any field not offered locally, such as medicine, they are provided with a full scholarship to study abroad.SportsFootball is the most popular sport in Botswana. Other popular sports are cricket, tennis, rugby, softball, handball, golf and and field.( )() Botswana is an associate member of the Cricket Council.Botswana has yet to win a medal at the Olympics, but in 2011 Montsho became world champion in the 400 metres and won Botswanas first athletics medal on world level.  Another famous Botswana athlete is high jumper Kgosiemang, three times African champion.The card game bridge has a strong following; it was first played in Botswana over 30 years ago and grew in popularity during the 1980s. Many British expatriate school teachers informally taught the game in Botswanas secondary schools. The Botswana Bridge Federation (BBF) was founded in 1988 and continues to organize tournaments. Bridge has remained popular and the BBF has over 800 members.() In 2007, the BBF invited the Bridge Union to host a week-long teaching program in May 2008.()CultureFile:Tsodilo Hills rock paintings4.jpg|thumb|Rock paintings of HillsBesides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana-whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.The Scottish writer, Alexander McCall Smith, has written a number of popular novels (1 Ladies Detective Agency series) about Botswana that entertain as well as inform the reader about the culture and customs of Botswana.MusicTswana music is mostly vocal and performed without drums; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane, Segankure/Segaba, and for the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music.Visual artsIn the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of Etsha and Gumare are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Palm and local dyes. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.Other notable artistic communities include Pottery and Weavers, both located in the southeastern part of Botswana.The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/Bushmen) over twenty thousand years ago within the Kalahari desert.In addition to these more traditional arts there are a number of extremely talented artists who use modern means to express themselves. There are a few galleries around Botswana that display paintings and sculptures. Some pieces are inspired by the beautiful Botswana landscapes and others by the people themselves.CuisineImage:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BoereworsThe cuisine of Botswana is unique but also shares some characteristics with other cuisine of Africa. Examples of Botswana food are Pap, Boerewors, Samp, Vetkoek and worms. A food unique to Botswana includes Seswaa, heavily salted mashed-up meat.HolidaysImage:Miss Botswana 08 Itseng Kgomotso.jpg|thumb|upright|Kgomotso, Miss Botswana 2008, during Miss World 2008See also*of Nations*in Botswana*of Botswana*stamps and postal history of Bechuanaland Protectorate*in Botswana*blockNotes and referencesFurther reading*.* Alexander McCall Smith: The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series.* Michael Stanley: A Carrion Death  part of the Detective Kubu seriesExternal links* http://www.botswanaportal.com*****list listace:Botswanaaf:Botswanaals:Botsuanaam:ang:Botswanaar:an:Botswanaroa-rup:Botswanafrp:Botsouanaast:Botsuanaaz:Botsvanabm:Botswanabn:zh-min-nan:Botswanabe:be-x-old:bcl:Botswanabo:bs:Bocvanabr:Botswanabg:ca:Botswanacv:ceb:Botswanacs:Botswanacy:Botswanada:Botswanapdc:Botswanade:Botsuanadv:Dine Bikyahet:Botswanael:es:Botsuanaeo:Bocvanoext:Botsuanaeu:Botswanaee:Botswanafa:hif:Botswanafo:Botsvanafr:Botswanafy:Botswanaff:BotswanaBhotsuinVotswaangag:Botsvanagd:Botsuanade Botsuana - Republic of Botswanahak:Pok-tsh-ng-napko:ha:Botswanahy:hi:hr:Bocvanaio:Botswanaig:Botswanailo:Botswanabpy:id:Botswanaia:Botswanaie:Botswanaos:zu:IButswanais:Botsvanait:Botswanahe:jv:Botswanakn:pam:Botswanaka:ks:kk:kw:Botswanarw:Botswanaky:sw:Botswanakg:Botswanaht:Botswanaku:Botswanaltg:Botsvanala:Botswanalv:Botsvanalb:Botswanalt:Botsvanalij:Btswanali:Botswanaln:Botswanajbo:botsuanaslmo:Botswanahu:Botswanamk:ml:mt:Botswanamr:arz:mzn:ms:Botswanamn:nah:Botzhuanana:Botwananl:Botswanaja:pih:Botswanano:Botswanann:Botswananov:Botswanaoc:Botswanauz:Botsvanapnb:pap:Botswanaps:pms:Botswanands:Botswanapl:Botswanapt:Botswanakaa:Botsvanacrh:Botsvanaksh:Botswanaro:Botswanarm:Botswanaqu:Butswanaru:sah:se:Botswanasa:sg:Botswanasc:Botzuanasco:Botswanastq:Botsuanatn:Botswanasq:Bocvanascn:Botsuanasimple:Botswanass:Butjwnask:Botswanasl:Bocvanaszl:Botswanaso:Botswanackb:sr:sh:Bocvanafi:Botswanasv:Botswanatl:Botswanata:tt:te:th:ti:tg:ve:Vhu-Tswanatr:Botsvanaudm:uk:ur:ug:vec:Botswanavi:Botswanavo:Zvannfiu-vro:Botswanawa:Boswanazh-classical:war:Botswanawo:Botswanawuu:ts:Botswanayo:Btswnzh-yue:diq:Botswanazea:Botswanabat-smg:Botsvanazh:

Burkina_Faso
footnote1                 The data here is an estimation for the year 2005 produced by the International Monetary Fund in April 2005.Burkina Faso (  ; )   also known by its short-form name Burkina  is a country in west Africa. It is surrounded by six countries: Mali to the north, Niger to the east, Benin to the southeast, Togo and Ghana to the south, and dIvoire to the southwest.Its size is  with an estimated population of more than 15,757,000. Formerly called the Republic of Upper Volta, it was renamed on 4 August 1984, by President Sankara to mean the land of upright people in Mor and Dioula, the major native languages of the country. Figuratively, Burkina may be translated, men of integrity, from the Mor language, and Faso means fathers house in Dioula. The inhabitants of Burkina Faso are known as Burkinab ( ).Burkina Faso was populated between 14,000 and 5000 BC by hunter-gatherers in the countrys northwestern region. Farm settlements appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC. What is now central Burkina Faso was principally composed of Mossi kingdoms. These Mossi Kingdoms would become a French protectorate in 1896. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the country underwent many governmental changes until arriving at its current form, a semi-presidential republic. The president is Compaor.Burkina Fasos capital is Ouagadougou. It is a member of the Union, of Sahel-Saharan States,Francophonie, of Islamic Cooperation and Community of West African States.History Early historyThe territory of todays Burkina Faso was populated very early, between 14,000 and 5000 BC, by hunter-gatherers in the northwestern part of the country, whose tools, such as scrapers, chisels and arrowheads, were discovered in 1973 bySimran Nijjar. Settlements with farmers appeared between 3600 and 2600 BC. On the basis of traces of the farmers structures, the settlements appear to have been permanent. The use of iron, ceramics and polished stone developed between 1500 and 1000 BC, as well as a preoccupation with spiritual matters, as shown by burial remains.Relics of the Dogon are found in Burkina Fasos north and northwest regions. Sometime between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Dogon left the area to settle in the cliffs of Bandiagara. Elsewhere, the remains of high walls are localized in the southwest of Burkina Faso (as well as in the Cte dIvoire), but the people who built them have not yet been identified.The central part of Burkina Faso included a number of Mossi kingdoms, the most powerful of which were those of Wagadogo (Ouagadougou) and Yatenga. These kingdoms emerged probably in the early sixteenth century from obscure origins veiled by legend featuring a heterogeneous set of warrior figures.(Michel Izard, Moogo. Lmergence dun espace tatique ouest-africain au XVIe sicle)From colony to independenceAfter a decade of intense rivalry and competition between the British and the French, waged through treaty-making expeditions under military or civilian explorers, the Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou was defeated by French colonial forces and became a French protectorate in 1896. The eastern region and the western region, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler Ture complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso today was nominally conquered; however, control of many parts remained uncertain.The French and British convention of 14 June 1898 ended the scramble between the two colonial powers and drew the borders between the countries colonies. On the French side, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the Volta basin were integrated into the Senegal and Niger colony of West Africa as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in Bamako.Draftees from the territory participated in the European fronts of War I in the battalions of the Senegalese Rifles. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government, known as the Volta-Bani War.(Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, West African Challenge to Empire, 2001) The French government finally suppressed the movement, but only after suffering defeats and being forced to gather the largest expeditionary force of its colonial history up to that point. Armed opposition also wracked the Sahelian north when the Tuareg and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.Upper Volta was established on 1 March 1919. This move was a result of French fears of the recurrence of armed uprising along with economic considerations, and to bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger. The new colony was named Haute Volta and Franois Charles Alexis douard Hesling became its first governor.Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy  based on coercion  failed, and revenue stagnated. The colony was later dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split up between the Cte dIvoire, Sudan and Niger. Cte dIvoire received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.The decision to split the colony was reversed during the intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of War II. On 4 September 1947, the colony was revived as a part of the Union, with its previous boundaries. On 11 December 1958, it achieved self-government and became the of Upper Volta and a member of the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganizational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.Upper VoltaThe Republic of Upper Volta () was established on 11 December 1958, as a colony within the Community. The name Upper Volta indicated that the country contains the upper part of the River system. The rivers three tributaries are called the Volta, Volta and Volta, and the colors of the national flag corresponded to these parts of the river system.Before attaining autonomy it had been Upper Volta and part of the Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from France. The first president, Yamogo, was the leader of the Democratic Union (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yamogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966 when after much unrestmass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servantsthe military intervened.The military coup deposed Yamogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. Lamizana at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years, and on 14 June 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.Lamizanas government faced problems with the countrys traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. Zerbo overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later, on 7 November 1982, by Maj. Dr. Oudraogo and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.Factional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and the radicals, led by Capt. Sankara, who was appointed prime minister in January 1983. The internal political struggle and Sankaras leftist rhetoric led to his arrest and subsequent efforts to bring about his release, directed by Capt. Compaor. This release effort resulted in yet another military coup dtat on 4 August 1983.After the coup, Sankara formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with himself as president. Sankara also established Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) to mobilize the masses and implement the CNRs revolutionary programs. The CNR, whose exact membership remained secret until the end, contained two small intellectual Marxist-Leninist groups. Sankara, Compaore, Capt. Zongo, and Maj. Linganiall leftist military officersdominated the regime.On 4 August 1984, as a final result of President Sankaras zealous activities, the countrys name was eventually changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which translates to land of honest people.(Kingfisher Geography Encyclopedia. ISBN 1-85613-582-9. Page 170) Burkina Faso On 15 October 1987 Sankara was killed by an armed gang with twelve other officials in a coup dtat organised by his former colleague, Blaise Compaor. Deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given, with Compaore stating that Sankara jeopardised foreign relations with former colonial power France and neighbouring Ivory Coast. Johnson, a former Liberian warlord allied to Charles Taylor, told Liberias Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that it was engineered by Charles Taylor. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days.Sankaras body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow and two children fled the nation. Compaor immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankaras policies, returned the country back under the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankaras legacy. As of 2010, Compaor is entering his 23rd year in power. He has become immensely wealthy and purchased a presidential plane to reflect his personal prestige, while landlocked Burkina Faso ranks as the third least developed country in the world.In FebruaryApril 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked an uprising throughout the country, coupled with a military mutiny and a strike of the magistrates, dubbed the Burkinab protests.PoliticsWith French help, the incumbent Blaise Compaor seized power in a coup dtat in 1987, betraying his long-time friend and ally Sankara, who was killed in the coup.(Burkina Fasos Blaise Compaore sacks his government, BBC News, 15 April 2011)The constitution of 2 June 1991 established a semi-presidential government with a parliament which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of seven years.In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. The amendment also would have prevented the incumbent president, Compaor, from being reelected.However, in October 2005, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, the constitutional council ruled that, because Compaor was the sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in the 2005 election. On 13 November, Compaor was reelected in a landslide, because of a divided political opposition.In the 2010 November Presidential elections, President Compaor was reelected for another term in office. Only 1.6 million Burkinabs voted, out of a total population 10 times that size.The parliament consists of one chamber known as the National Assembly which has 111 seats with members elected to serve five year terms. There is also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles are purely consultative.Political freedoms are severely restricted in Burkina Faso, with human rights organisations decrying numerous acts of state-sponsored violence against journalists and other politically active members of society.Regions, provinces, and departmentsBurkina Faso is divided into thirteen regions, forty-five provinces, and 301 departments. The regions are:*Boucle du Mouhoun*Cascades*Centre*Centre-Est*Centre-Nord*Centre-Ouest*Centre-Sud*Est*Hauts-Bassins*Nord*Plateau-Central*Sahel*Sud-OuestMilitary, police, and security forcesThe country employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by French police, and France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces in Burkina Faso.(Das, Dilip K. and Palmiotto, Michael J., World Police Encyclopedia, Routledge, ISBN 0415942500, 9780415942508, (2005), pp. 139141)  The Gendarmerie Nationale is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level.(Das, pp. 139141)  The Gendarmerie operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders.(There is also a municipal police force controlled by the Ministry of Territorial Administration; a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security; and an autonomous Presidential Security Regiment (Rgiment de la Scurit Prsidentielle, or RSP), a palace guard devoted to the protection of the President of the Republic.(  Both the gendarmerie and the national police are subdivided into both administrative and judicial police functions; the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security, the latter are charged with criminal investigations.(All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports, or other forms of identification or risk a fine, and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto, bush-taxi, or bus.(U.S. Dept. of State, Burkina Faso: Country Specific Information)(Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso)The army consists of some 6,000 men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national Peoples Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35 years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties. According to Janes Sentinel Country Risk Assessment, Burkina Fasos Army is small and poorly equipped, but has numbers of wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.The army is relatively well-funded and motivated by African standards, although undermanned for its force structure. The regular army is believed to be neglected in relation to the lite Presidential Security Regiment (RSP) and reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions.(Janes Sentinel Security Assessment  West Africa, 15 April 2009)  There is an air force with some 19 operational aircraft, but no navy, as the country is landlocked. Military expenses constitute approximately 1.2% of the nations GDP.In April 2011, there was an army mutiny; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in Ouagadougou.()Geography and climateBurkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes 9 and 15N (a small area is north of 15), and longitudes 6W and 3E.It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a peneplain, which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak, Tnakourou, is found at an elevation of . The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to  high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is  and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than . Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the Volta (or Mouhoun), the Volta (Nakamb) and the Volta (Nazinon). The Black Volta is one of the countrys only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the Komo, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the River also drains 27% of the countrys surface.The Nigers tributaries  the Bli, the Gorouol, the Goudbo and the Dargol  are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large floods. The country also contains numerous lakes  the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Bli, Yomboli and Markoye. Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.File:WP 35, SDr9776.JPG|left|thumb|Savannah near the Department, on the road from Gaoua to Bati.Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between  of rainfall; in the dry season, the harmattan  a hot dry wind from the Sahara  blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than () of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, .A relatively dry savanna, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 113 and 135 north latitude, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than ( of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.Burkina Fasos natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt and small deposits of gold.Burkina Fasos fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see of national parks in Africa, reserves of Burkina Faso.EconomyFile:Balga, February 2010, Women around the water pump.jpg|thumb|recht|220px|A pump in Burkina Faso.This file has annotations. Move the mouse pointer over the image to see themBurkina Faso has one of the lowest GDP per capita figures in the world: $1,200.() Agriculture represents 32% of its gross domestic product and occupies 80% of the working population. It consists mostly of livestock but also, especially in the south and southwest, of growing sorghum, millet, maize (corn), peanuts, rice and cotton. A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid.Burkina Faso was ranked the 111th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.()Remittances used to be an important source of income to Burkina Faso until the 1990s, when unrest in Cte dIvoire, the main destination for Burkinabe emigrants, forced many to return home. Remittances now account for less than 1% of GDP.Burkina Faso is part of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UMEOA) and has thus adopted the CFA Franc, which is issued by the Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), situated in Dakar, Senegal. The BCEAO is not only responsible for the monetary and reserve policy of the member states, but also for the regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity. A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. Micro-finance institutions are governed by a separate law, which regulates micro-finance activities in all WAEMU countries. The insurance sector is regulated through the Inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets (CIMA).(MFW4A)There is mining of copper, iron, manganese and gold. These operations provide employment, international aid, and in some cases hospitals at mines for the public.Burkina Faso also hosts the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou, better known by its French name as SIAO, Le Salon International de l Artisanat de Ouagadougou, one of the most important African handicraft fairs.Burkina Faso is a member of the for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).()While services remain underdeveloped, one state-owned company run along commercial lines is emerging as one of the best performing utility companies in Africa, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA).(Peter Newborne 2011.

London: Development Institute) High levels of autonomy and a skilled and dedicated management has driven ONEAs ability to improve production of and access to water.( Since 2000, nearly 2 million people more people have access to water in the four principal urban centres in the country while at the same time keeping the quality of infrastructure high (less than 18% of the water is lost through leaks  one of the lowest in Africa), improving financial reporting and an average 12% annual revenue increase (well above inflation).( Challenges remain, including the some customers ability to pay and a reliance on aid for the expansion of its infrastructure.( However, the state-owned commercially run venture has helped lead Burkina Fasos Development Goal (MDG) targets in its water-related targets and grow as a viable company.(DemographicsFile:Ouagadougou place nations unies.JPG|thumb|United Nations Square in Ouagadougou, Burkina FasoBurkina Fasos 15.3 million people belong to two major West African cultural groupsthe Voltaic and the Mande (whose common language is Dioula). The Voltaic Mossi make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from Ghana and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is still led by the Naba, whose court is in Ouagadougou.(Burkina Faso. U.S. Department of State (June 2008). )Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkinas people are concentrated in the south and center of the country, sometimes exceeding 48 per square kilometer (125/sq. mi.). Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe migrate to Cte dIvoire and Ghana, many for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are obviously affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Cte dIvoire and the ensuing fighting there have meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabe returned to Burkina Faso.(HealthAverage life expectancy at birth in 2004 was estimated at 52 for females and 50 for males.()  The median age of its inhabitants is 16.7. The estimated population growth rate is 3.109%.(Burkina Faso.

The of Burkina Faso stated in its most recent census (2006) that 60.5% of the population practice Islam, and that the majority of this group belong to the Sunni branch,()(International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Burkina Faso. United States of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (17 November 2010). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the domain.) while a growing minority adheres to the Shia branch. A significant number of Sunni Muslims identify with the Tijaniyah Sufi order. The Government also estimated that some 23.2% are Christians (19% being Roman Catholics and 4.2% members of various Protestant denominations), 15.3% follow Traditional indigenous beliefs, 0.6% have other religions, and 0.4% have none (atheism is virtually nonexistent).((A popular saying in Burkina Faso claims that 50% are Muslim, 50% are Christian, and 100% are animist. This shows the large level of acceptance of the various religions amongst each other. Even for Muslims and Christians, ancient animist rites are still highly valued. The Great Mosque of Bobo-Dioulasso was built by people of different faiths working together.CultureFile:BoboDioulasso-CineSanyonE.JPG|left|thumb|Cinema Sanyon in Bobo-Dioulasso.in Burkina Faso is based on the tradition, which remains important.In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his Maximes, penses et devinettes mossi (Maximes, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi), a record of the oral history of the people.() The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinab writers in the post-independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s, such as Boni and Roger Nikiema.() The 1960s saw a growth in the number of playwrights being published.( Since the 1970s, literature has developed in Burkina Faso with many more writers being published.()The of Burkina Faso combines traditional Burkinab  performance with the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with masks. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by theatre. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by forum theatre aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Fasos rural people.CuisineThe cuisine of Burkina Faso, typical of west African cuisine, is based around foods of sorghum, millet, rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes, beans, yams and okra.() The most common sources of protein are chicken, chicken eggs and fresh water fish. A typical Burkinab beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented palm sap, and Zoom-kom. Especially the town of Banfora is known for its good quality Banji, though one should be wary of the Banji sold by hawkers as it is often not very fresh and may contain added water.On 30 August 2009, Burkina Faso experienced the worst flood in the countrys recent history, leaving 150,000 people homeless, and more than 8 people dead. Burkina Faso people requested international aid to help the victims and rebuild the country. Japan, France, Ivory Coast and the European Union responded, while the Burkina American community requested that the president of the United States of America extend a helping hand to the victims of the flood. As a result of the flood, access to clean water has been difficult for survivors.CinemaThe of Burkina Faso is an important part of West African and African film industry.(Spaas,Lieve, Burkina Faso, in The Francophone Film: A Struggle for Identity,  pp. 232246. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000) Burkinas contribution to cinema started with the establishment of the film festival FESPACO (Festival Panafricain du Cinma et de la Tlvision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969. Many of the nations filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes. For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara (In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagaoudougou). Among the best known directors from Burkina Faso are: Kabor, Ouedraogo and Kouyate,(Turgano, Teresa Hoefert, African Cinema and Europe: Close-Up on Burkina Faso, Florence: European Press Academic, 2005.)  Burkina also produces popular television series such as Bobodjiouf. The internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate also make popular television series.SportsSport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football (soccer),basketball, cycling, Rugby union, handball, tennis, athletics, boxing and martial arts. Football is very popular in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed Les Etalons (the Stallions) in reference to the legendary horse of Princess Yennenga. In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the African Cup of Nations for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built.The country is currently ranked 42nd in the World Rankings.()Educationthumb|left|280px|School children in DourtengaEducation in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education.() However schooling costs approximately CFA 50,000 ($97 USD) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinab families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls schooling has been observed because of the governments policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships. In order to proceed from elementary to middle school, middle to high school or high school to college, national exams must be passed. Institutions of higher education include the of Ouagadougou, The Polytechnical University in Bobo-Dioulasso and the University of Koudougou, which is also a teacher training institution. There are private colleges in the capital city of Ouagadougou but these are affordable by only a small portion of the population.There is also an School of Ouagadougou (ISO), which is an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.The UN Development Program Report ranks Burkina Faso as the country with the lowest level of literacy in the world, despite a concerted effort to double its literacy rate from 12.8% in 1990 to 25.3% in 2008.()National and independent mediaThe nations principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, Radiodiffusion-Tlvision Burkina (RTB).() RTB broadcasts on two medium-wave (AM) and several FM frequencies. Besides RTB, there are also a number of privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations.  RTB also maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast (Radio Nationale Burkina) in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100 kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030 MHz.(Radio Station World, Burkina Faso: Governmental Broadcasting Agencies)Attempts to develop an independent press and media in Burkina Faso have been intermittent. In 1998, investigative journalist Zongo, his brother Ernest, his driver, and another man were assassinated by unknown assailants, and the bodies burned. The crime was never solved.(Committee to Protect Journalists, Burkina Faso)  However, an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo, a chauffeur who worked for Franois Compaor, President Blaise Compaors brother.In January 1999, Franois Compaor was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal. In August 2000, five members of the Presidents personal security guard detail (Rgiment de la Scurit Prsidentielle, or RSP) were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo. RSP members Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama, and Ousseini Yaro, investigated as suspects in the Norbert Zongo assassination, were convicted in the Ouedraogo case and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.(Reporters Sans Frontieres, Whats Happening About The Inquiry Into Norbert Zongos Death?)(Reporters Sans Frontieres, Outrageous Denial Of Justice 21 July 2006)Since the death of Norbert Zongo, several protests regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces. In April 2007, popular radio reggae host Karim Sama, whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.(IFEX, Radio Station Temporarily Pulls Programme After Host Receives Death Threats, 26 April 2007)  Samas personal car was later burned outside the private radio station Ouaga FM by unknown vandals.(FreeMuse.org, Death threat against Reggae Radio Host, 3 May 2007)  In response, the to Protect Journalists (CPJ) wrote to President Compaor to request his government investigate the sending of e-mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government.(  In December 2008, police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination.

Economy_of_the_Bahamas
cianame  bfBahamas is a stable, developing nation with an economy heavily dependent on tourism and banking. Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP growth in recent years, but the slowdown in the US economy and the attacks of September 11, 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001-03. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many international businesses have left The Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US, the source of more than 80% of the visitors. In addition to tourism and banking, the government supports the development of a 2nd-pillar, e-commerce.Basic Ingredients of the Bahamian EconomyThe Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial services to generate foreign exchange earnings. Tourism alone provides an estimated 60% of the domestic product (GDP) and employs about half the Bahamian workforce. In 2004, over half a million tourists visited The Bahamas, most of whom are from the States.A major contribution to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is Kerzner Internationals Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former Paradise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In addition, the opening of Breezes Super Club and Sandals Resort also aided this turnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to courting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the East, Europe, America, and Canada. The primary purpose of the trips was to restore the reputation of The Bahamas in these markets.Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for up to 17% of GDP, due to the countrys status as an offshore financial center. As of December 1998, the government had licensed 418 banks and trust companies in The Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International Business Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the countrys status as a leading financial center. The act served to simplify and reduce the cost of incorporating offshore companies in The Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than 84,000 IBC-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the government also legalized the establishment of Asset Protection Trusts in The Bahamas. In December 2000, partly as a response to appearing the plenary Blacklist, the government enacted a legislative package to better regulate the financial sector, including creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and enforcement of know-your-customer rules. Other initiatives include the enactment of the Foundations Act in 2004 and the planned introduction of legislation to regulate Private Trust Companies.Agriculture and fisheries industry together account for 5% of GDP. The Bahamas exports lobster and some fish but does not raise these items commercially. There is no largescale agriculture, and most agricultural products are consumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in foodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate foreign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing agricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government officially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts, dairy production, winter vegetables, and mariculture (shrimp farming) as the areas in which it wishes to encourage foreign investment.The Bahamian Government maintains the value of the dollar on a par with the dollar. The Bahamas is a beneficiary of the U.S.-Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), Canadas CARIBCAN program, and the European Unions Lome IV Agreement. Although the Bahamas participates in the political aspects of the Community (CARICOM), it has not entered into joint economic initiatives with other Caribbean states.The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical firm, PFC Bahamas (formerly Syntex), which recently streamlined its production and was purchased by the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche; the BORCO oil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the Brewery in Nassau, which produces Heineken, Guinness, and Kalik beers; and Bacardi Corp., which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the U.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in Great Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and mining of aragonitea type of limestone with several industrial usesfrom the sea floor at Ocean Cay.  Other smaller but more nimble players in the banking industry include Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) Ltd. (FBB) and Royal Fidelity Merchant Bank & Trust Limited (RFMBT).  FBB offers a wide range of innovative banking products including loan products with built-in savings plans.  RFMBT is the only merchant bank in The Bahamas and is a joint venture with Royal Bank of Canada.  It provides investment products and services and attracts the majority of the corporate business deals in The Bahamas, most recently acting as financial advisor and placement agent for the largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) ever in The Bahamas with the  IPO of Commonwealth Brewery, a Heineken subsidiary. The Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, The Bahamas second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage foreign industrial investment. The Kong-based firm, Whampoa, has opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved legislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions through 2054.The Bahamas is largely an import, economy. There are about 110 U.S.-affiliated businesses operating in The Bahamas, and most are associated with tourism and banking. With few domestic resources and little industry, The Bahamas imports nearly all its food and manufactured goods from the United States. American goods and services tend to be favored by Bahamians due to cultural similarities and heavy exposure to American advertising.Business environmentThe Bahamas offers attractive features to the potential investor: a stable democratic environment, relief from personal and corporate income taxes, timely repatriation of corporate profits, proximity to the U.S. with extensive air and telecommunications links, and a good pool of skilled professional workers. The Government of The Bahamas welcomes foreign investment in tourism and banking and has declared an interest in agricultural and industrial investments to generate local employment, particularly in white-collar or skilled jobs. Despite its interest in foreign investment to diversify the economy, the Bahamian Government responds to local concerns about foreign competition and tends to protect Bahamian business and labor interests. As a result of domestic resistance to foreign investment and high labor costs, growth can stagnate in sectors which the government wishes to diversify.The countrys infrastructure is best developed in the principal cities of Nassau and Freeport, where there are relatively good paved roads and international airports. Electricity is generally reliable, although many businesses have their own backup generators. In Nassau, there are two daily newspapers, three weeklies, and several international newspapers available for sale. There also are eight radio stations. Both Nassau and Freeport have a television station. Cable TV also is available locally and provides most American programs with some Canadian and European channels.Areas of opportunityThe best U.S. export opportunities remain in the traditional areas of foodstuffs and manufactured goods: vehicles and parts; hotel, restaurant, and medical supplies; and computers and electronics. Bahamian tastes in consumer products roughly parallel those in the U.S. With approximately 85% of the population of primarily African descent, there is a large and growing market in the Bahamas for ethnic personal care products. Merchants in southern Florida have found it profitable to advertise in Bahamian publications. Most imports in this sector are subject to high but nondiscriminatory tariffs.Statistics*Household income or consumption by percentage share**highest 10%: 27% (2000)*Agriculture - products**citrus, vegetables; poultry*Electricity - production**2,505 GWh (2007 est.) - Rank 133*Electricity - consumption**1,793 GWh (2007) - Rank 133*Oil - consumption** (2006 est.) - Rank 115*Oil - exports**transhipments of  (2003)*Exchange rates**dollars per dollar - 1 (2008), 1 (2007), 1 (2006), 1 (2005), 1 (2004)The Bahamas has the 47th freest economy in the world according to Heritage Foundation 2010 of Economic Freedom. The Bahamas is ranked 7th out of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region, and its overall score is higher than the regional and world averages. Total government spending, including consumption and transfer payments, is relatively low. In the most recent year, government spending equaled 23.4 percent of GDP.References* Some of the material in this article comes from the World Factbook 2009.*http://statistics.bahamas.gov.bs/key.php?cmdview&id164de les Bahamesde Bahamasdas Bahamasdi Bahamade las Bahamasdas Bahamas

Armed_Forces_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina
ranksranks and insignia of Bosnia and HerzegovinaThe Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: Oruane snage Bosne i Hercegovine, OSBIH Cyrillic script:     , ) is the official military force of and Herzegovina. The Bosnian Armed forces were unified in 2005 and are composed of two founding armies: Bosniak-Croat, of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Serb, of Republika Srpska.The of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina, founded in 2004, is in charge of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are approximately 11,000 active troops, 5,000 reserve troops, and 500 civilian staff.Chain of commandThe supreme commander of the Bosnian Armed Forces is the current president of Bosnia and Herzegovina thus the Presidency commands the Bosnian Army, then the Bosnian Ministry of Defence with the minister Cikoti, then the Chiefs of Joint Staff with Podi as the head of the chiefs. The BiH Chief of Joint Staff is Lieutenant General Miladin Miloji. Conscription was completely abolished in Bosnia and Herzegovina effective on and from 1 January 2006.(NATO and the Defence Reform Commission: partners for progress (SETimes.com) ) Defense lawThe Bosnia and Herzegovina Defense Law addresses the following areas: the Military of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Government Institutions, Entity jurisdictions and structure, Budget and Financing, Composition of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, War declaration, Natural disasters, Conflict of interests and professionalism, Oath to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Flags, Anthem and Military Insignia, and transitional and end orders.HistoryThe AFBiH was formed from three armies of the War period: the Bosnian (dominantly Bosniak with numbers of Serbs and Croats) of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnian Serb of Republika Srpska, and the Defence Council.The Army of the Republic of Bosnia And Herzegovina was created on 15 April 1992 during the early days of the War. Before the ARBiH was formally created, there existed Territorial Defence, an official military force of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a number of paramilitary groups such as the Green Berets, League, and defense groups, as well as many criminal gangs and collections of police and military professionals. The army was formed under poor circumstances, with a very low number of tanks, APCs and no military aviation assets. The army was divided into Corps, each Corp was stationed in a territory. First commander was Halilovi.The Army of Republika Srpska was created on 12 May 1992. Before the VRS was formally created, there were a number of paramilitary groups such as the Srpska Dobrovoljaka Garda, Beli Orlovi, as well as some Russian, Greek and other volunteers. The army was equipped with ex-JNA inventory. It had about 200 tanks, mostly T-55s and 85 M-84s, and 150 APCs with several heavy artillery pieces. The Air Defense of VRS has shot down several aircraft, like F-16, 2000, F-18 and one Air Force MiG-21. The VRS received support from the Army and FRY until 1994, when Slobodan Miloevi stopped military relations with Srpska.The Defence Council was the main military formation of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia during the Bosnian War and it was first organized military force to with the aim to control the Croat populated areas. It is not to be confused with the Defence Forces (HOS) which was a separate Croatian military unit.In 1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor the military aspects of the Peace Agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or SFOR. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 and then to 7,000. SFOR was in turn succeeded by an even smaller, Union-led European Union Force, Althea. As of 2004, EUFOR Althea numbered around 7,000 troops.As the joint AFBiH began to develop, troops began to be sent abroad. Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel as part of the force in Iraq. The unit was first deployed to Fallujah, then Air Base, and is now located at Echo. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th infantry division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard Victory in Baghdad.StructureThe Military units are commanded by the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint Staff in Sarajevo. There are two major commands under the Joint Staff: Operational Command and Support Command.There are three regiments that are each formed by soldiers from the three ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs and trace their roots to the armies that were created during the Bosnian war. These regiments have their distinct ethnic insignias and consist of three active battalions each. Each regiments three battalions divided evenly between the three active brigades of the Army.* Operational Command (Sarajevo)(As per http://www.mod.gov.ba/en/shema.asp?idodb)** 4th Infantry Brigade (Tuzla)*** (Bosniak) Infantry Battalion (Tuzla)*** (Serbian) Infantry Battalion (Bijeljina)*** (Croatian) Infantry Battalion (Oraje)*** Reconnaissance Company*** Signals Platoon** 5th Infantry Brigade (Luka)*** (Serbian) Infantry Battalion (Banja Luka)*** (Croatian) Infantry Battalion (Livno)*** (Bosniak) Infantry Battalion (Biha)*** Reconnaissance Company*** Signals Platoon** 6th Infantry Brigade (apljina)*** (Croatian) Infantry Battalion (apljina)*** (Bosniak) Infantry Battalion (Gorade)*** (Serbian) Infantry Battalion (Bilea)*** Reconnaissance Company*** Signals Platoon** Tactical Support Brigade (Sarajevo)*** Armored Battalion (Tuzla)*** Artillery Battalion (epe) (one battery detached to each brigade)*** Engineer Battalion (one company detached to each brigade)*** Military Intelligence Battalion (Butilama)*** Military Police Battalion (Butilama) (one platoon detached to each brigade)*** De-mining Battalion (Bugojno)*** Signals Company (Sarajevo)*** NBC Defense Company** Air Force & Anti-Air Defense Brigade (Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla)*** Helicopter Battalion (Sarajevo) (one squadron detached to each brigade HQ)*** Air Defense Battalion (Sarajevo) (one company detached to each brigade)*** Early Warning & Surveillance Battalion (Banja Luka)*** Flight Support Battalion (Sarajevo, Banja Luka)thumb|250px|Chiefs of Joint Staff structure*Support Command (Banja Luka)** Personnel Command** Training and Doctrine Command*** Combat Training Center**** Armored Mechanized Battalion*** Combat Simulation Center*** Professional Development Center**** Officers School**** NCO School**** Foreign Language Center** Logistics Command*** Center for Movement Control*** Center for Material Management*** Main Logistics Base (Doboj and Sarajevo)*** 1st Logistics Support Battalion*** 2nd Logistics Support Battalion*** 3rd Logistics Support Battalion*** 4th Logistics Support Battalion*** 5th Logistics Support BattalionWithin the armed forces, there are a number of services.

Uniform and Insignia Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were unified in 2005 and at that time they needed a uniform for the newley founded army. MARPAT where the future uniform of AFBIH.Insignia is found on military hats or berets, on the right and left shoulder on the uniform of all Soldiers of the Armed Forces. All, except for generals, wear badges on their hats or berets with either the land force badge or air force badge. Generals wear badges with the coat of arms of Bosnia surrounded with branches and two swords.All soldiers of the armed forces have on their right shoulder a flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All members of the 3 regiments wear their regiment insignia on the left shoulder. There are other insignias, brigades or other institution are worn under the regiment insignia. The name of the soldiers is worn on the left part of the chest while the name Armed Forces of BiH is worn on the right part of the chest.EquipmentInfantry weapons! styletext-align: left; background: #aacccc;|Assault Rifle! styletext-align: left; background: #aacccc;|Origin! styletext-align: left; background: #aacccc;|Type! styletext-align: left; background: #aacccc;|Versions! styletext-align: left; background: #aacccc;|Notes|-----| rifle| | Assault Rifle| A1 and A2| From 2010 OSBiH will scrap the A1 versions, and use A2 and A4 versions.

Geography_of_Botswana
largest lake  thumb|Elevation map of BotswanaBotswana is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa, north of Africa.  Botswana occupies an area of 600,370 square kilometres, of which 585,000 km are land.  Botswana has land boundaries of combined length 4,013 kilometres, of which the constituent boundaries are shared with Namibia, for 1,360 km; Africa 1,840 km; Zimbabwe, 813 km and Zambia, less than 1 km.  Much of the population of Botswana is concentrated in the eastern part of the country.|1}}. Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.(General Survey of Climatology, Landsberg (ed.),Elsevier, 2001)OrographyThe land is predominantly flat to gently undulating tableland, although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The Desert is in the central and the southwest.  The Delta, the worlds largest inland delta, is in the northwest and the Pans, a large salt pan lies in the north-central area.  The Makgadikgadi has been established as an early habitation area for primitive man; This large seasonal wetland is composed of several large component pans, the largest being Pan, Pan and Pan.(C. Michael Hogan (2008) Makgadikgadi, Megalithic Portal, ed. A.Burnham) Botswanas lowest elevation point is at the junction of the Limpopo and Shashe Rivers, at a height of 513 m.  The highest point is Hill, at 1,494 m.The country is divided into four drainage regions, which are sometimes indistinct due to the arid nature of the climate:* the River on the border with the Strip of Namibia together with a small adjacent swampy area is part of the Zambezi basin;* most of the north and central region of the country is part of the Okavango inland drainage basin;* the easternmost part of the country falls into the Limpopo drainage basin;* the southern and southwestern regions, which are the driest of all, are drained by the Molopo river along the South African border and the Nossob river through the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, and are technically part of the basin of the river. None of these rivers normally flows as far as the Orange, however. (The last recorded confluence was in the 1880s.)(Times Comprehensive Atlas, (2007), Times Books, London)Except for the Chobe, Okavango, Boteti and rivers, most of Botswanas rivers cease to flow during the dry and early rainy seasons.Natural hazardsBotswana is affected by periodic droughts, and seasonal August winds blow from the west, carrying sand and dust, which can obscure visibility.EnvironmentCurrent environmental issues in Botswana are overgrazing, desertification and the existence of only limited fresh water resources.Research from the of Botswana has found that the common practice of overstocking cattle to cope with drought losses actually depletes scarce biomass, making ecosystems more vulnerable. The study of the Kgatleng district predicts that by 2050 the cycle of mild drought is likely to become shorter 18 months instead of two yearsdue to change.(Sub-Saharan Africa news in brief: 1022 April 2008 - SciDev.Net)International agreementsBotswana is a party to the following international agreements:  Diamond Industry, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection and Wetlands.

Economy_of_Botswana
spelling        Since independence, Botswana has had the highest average economic growth rate in the world, averaging about 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Growth in private sector employment has averaged about 10% per annum over the first 30 years of independence. The relatively high quality of the countrys statistics means that these figures are likely to be quite accurate. The government has consistently maintained budget surpluses and has extensive exchange reserves.Botswanas impressive economic record has been built on a foundation of diamond mining, prudent fiscal policies, international financial and technical assistance, and a cautious foreign policy. It is rated the least corrupt country in Africa, according to an international corruption watchdog, International. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest national income at power parity in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of Mexico and Turkey.(GNI PPP table)Trade unions represent a minority of workers in the Botswana economy. In general they are loosely organized in-house unions, although the Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU) is consolidating its role as the sole trade union centre in the country.()()OverviewAgriculture still provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and accounts for only 3% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle raising predominate. The sector is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. Tourism is also important to the economy. Substantial mineral deposits were found in the 1970s and the mining sector grew from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 38% in 1998. Unemployment officially is 21% but unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The Orapa 2000 project doubled the capacity of the countrys main mine from early 2000. This will be the main force behind continued economic expansion. Economic growth slowed in 2007-2008, then turned negative in 2009, contracting by 5.2%. This was due in part to a major resession in the industrial sector, which shrank by 30%,( and contrasts with most other African nations who experienced continued growth through this period.(https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2003rank.html, see also Real Growth.svg) Some of Botswanas budget deficits can be traced to relatively high military expenditures (about 4% of GDP in 2004, according to the World Factbook). Some critics contend this is unnecessary, given the low likelihood of international conflict, but these troops are also used for multilateral operations and assistance efforts. Trade Botswana is part of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) with South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia. The Bank reports that in 2001 (the most recent year for which World Bank data are available), the SACU had a weighted average external tariff rate of 3.6 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, There are very few tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade with Botswana, apart from restrictions on licensing for some business operations, which are reserved for Botswana companies. Based on the revised trade factor methodology, Botswanas trade policy score is unchanged.(Botswana and WTO)The main export of Botswana is diamonds. Jwaneng, in Botswana, is the worlds largest and richest diamond mine thus the demand of diamonds from Botswana is fairly high. The mine was discovered when termites looking for water brought grains of diamond to the surface. If the great demand of diamonds were to go into rapid decline, then the economy of Botswana would suffer greatly as they are highly dependent on this export. The diamond mine in Jwaneng provides many jobs for the unemployed in Botswana as people are needed to physically extract the diamonds, and to build the roads needed for their transport, for example. A source of foreign exchange is also introduced to the economy and it offers a potential basis for industrial development, and thus stimulates improvements within Botswanas infrastructure.MiningTwo large mining companies, Debswana (formed by the government and South Africas Beers in equal partnership) and Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd. (BCL, also with substantial government equity participation) operate in the country.File:Jwaneng Open Mine.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The diamond mine is the richest in the world today.Since the early 1980s, the country has been the worlds largest producer of gem diamonds. Four large diamond mines have opened since independence. De Beers prospectors discovered diamonds in northern Botswana in the early 1970s. The first mine began production at Orapa in 1972, followed by the smaller mine at Letlhakane. What has become the single-richest diamond mine in the world opened in Jwaneng in 1982. In 2002, a fourth diamond mine, Damtshaa, began operations.  Botswana produced a total over 30 million carats (6,000 kg) of diamonds (about 25% of worldwide production) from the three Debswana mines in 1999, and is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. The Orapa 2000 Expansion of the existing Orapa mine was opened in 2000. A fifth diamond mine and the first not operated by Debswana is scheduled to have begun operations in 2008 in Lerala.() Most (70%) of Botswanas electricity is imported from South Africas Eskom. 80% of domestic production is concentrated in one plant, Power Station near Palapye, operated by the Power Corporation.(http://web.archive.org/web/20060217023857/http://www.miningweekly.co.za/min/sector/coal/?show75117) Debswana operates the nearby Colliery to supply coal to it.(http://www.miningweekly.co.za/min/sector/coal/?show75117) In early 2008, the entire southern African region was hit hard by massive shortages in power, since the region works to share its power resources through the Southern African Power Pool, with most of the capacity coming from South Africa. Botswana has in turn put in place plans through governmental expansion of the Morupule power station, as well as encouraging private investment in the form of a 4,000 megawatt power station by the Canadian Greenfield company CIC Energy to become a net exporter of power to the regional pool.BCL, which operates a copper-nickel mine at Selebi-Phikwe, has had a troubled financial history but remains an important employer. The soda ash operation at Sua Pan, opened in 1991 and supported by substantial government investment, has begun making a profit following significant restructuring.TourismFile:Giraffe standing.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A giraffe in the Central Kalahari Game ReserveTourism is an increasingly important industry in Botswana, accounting for almost 12% of GDP. One of the worlds unique ecosystems, the Delta, is located in Botswana.

Botswanas Kalahari Game Reserve also offers good game viewing and some of the most remote and unspoiled wilderness in southern Africa.Tourism plays a large role in the Botswana economy.  A number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife and wetlands, are major tourist attractions.  The wildlife, including lions, brown hyenas, cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs and antelope, were described in great detail in the best-selling book Cry of the Kalahari by Mark and Delia Owens.The main safari destinations for tourism are Game Reserve in the Delta, and National Park. Botswana is also participating in community based natural resource management projects by trying to involve villagers in tourism. One example is the village of Khwai and its Khwai Development Trust. Botswana was the setting for the 1980 movie Gods Must Be Crazy, although the movie was mostly filmed in South Africa.The seventh season of the Race visited Botswana. Tourism has been stimulated by the series of detective novels by McCall Smith and the American dramatisation that followed them.AgricultureMore than half of Batswana (preferred address of the Botswana people) live in rural areas and are dependent on subsistence crop and livestock farming, together with money sent home by relatives in urban areas. Agriculture meets only a small portion of food needs and contributes just 2.8% to GDPprimarily through beef exportsbut it remains a social and cultural touchstone. Cattle raising dominated Botswanas social and economic life before independence. The Meat Commission has a monopoly on beef production. The national herd was about 2.5 million in the mid-1990s, though the government-ordered slaughter of the entire herd in Botswanas north-west Kgamiland District in 1995 has reduced the number by at least 200,000. The slaughter was ordered to prevent the spread of cattle lung disease to other parts of the country.Only about 0.7% of total land area is arable. Crop production is hampered by traditional farming methods, recurrent drought, erosion, and disease. Most of the land under cultivation is in the eastern region. The principal crops for domestic use are sorghum, corn, and millet. Sorghum and corn production in 2004 were 32,000 tons and 10,000 tons, respectively. The sorghum and corn harvests comprise less than 10% of the annual requirement of 250,000 tons. In 2004, Botswanas agricultural imports (primarily cereals) exceeded agricultural exports by $102.5 million. Grainis often imported from South Africa. Smaller quantities of cowpeas, beans, and other pulses are also grown. The 2004 output of all these crops was about 20,000 tons; in addition, 16,000 tons of vegetables and 10,000 tons of fruit were grown.Agricultural research has been devoted to soil conservation, grazing experiments, and developing and distributing improved strains of grain. The construction of dams and the drilling of boreholes to tap underground water are continuing government programs. In early 1990, the government changed its official agricultural policy to emphasize the production only of those foodstuffs that can be raised economically. The Arable Lands DevelopmentProgram and the Tribal Grazing Land Policy are government programs designed to help farmers in communal areas.Private sector development and foreign investmentBotswana seeks to diversify its economy away from minerals, the earnings from which have levelled off. In 1998-99, non-mineral sectors of the economy grew at 8.9%, partially offsetting a slight 4.4% decline in the minerals sector. Foreign investment and management have been welcomed in Botswana.External investment in Botswana has grown fitfully. In the early 1990s, two American companies, Owens Corning and H.J. Heinz, made major investments in production facilities in Botswana. In 1997, the St. Paul Group purchased Botswana Insurance, one of the countrys leading short-term insurance providers. An American Business Council (ABC), with over 30 member companies, was inaugurated in 1995.Hyundai operated a car assembly plant in Botswana from 1994 to 2000.(The Government of Botswana - Economic Snapshot)File:Tourist Resort at Kasane.jpg|thumb|right|Tourist resort at KasaneBotswana seeks to further diversify its economy away from minerals, which account for a quarter of GDP, down from nearly half of GDP in the early 1990s.  Foreign investment and management are welcomed in Botswana, and as a result, financial and services sectors have increased at an exponential rate in the 2000s to replace mining as the leading industry.  Botswana abolished exchange controls in 1999, has a low corporate tax rate (15%), no prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies, and a moderate inflation rate (7.6% November 2004).  The Government of Botswana is currently considering additional policies to enhance competitiveness, including a new Foreign Direct Investment Strategy, Competition Policy, Privatisation Master Plan, and National Export Development Strategy.Botswana is known to have vast coal deposits making it possibly one of the most coal rich countries in the world. Large coal mines, massive coal fired power plants, as well as a coals to liquid plant (through the process) to produce synthetic automotive fuel have been planned. With its proven record of good economic governance, Botswana was ranked as Africas least corrupt country by International in 2004, ahead of many European and Asian countries.  The World Economic Forum rates Botswana as one of the two most economically competitive nations in Africa.  In 2004 Botswana was once again assigned A grade credit ratings by Moodys and & Poors. This ranks Botswana as by far the best credit risk in Africa and puts it on par with or above many countries in central Europe, East Asia, and Latin America.U.S. investment in Botswana remains at relatively low levels, but continues to grow. Major U.S. corporations, such as Heinz and Corporation, are present through direct investments, while others, such as Fried Chicken and Remax, are present via franchise.  The sovereign credit ratings by Moodys and Standard & Poors clearly indicate that, despite continued challenges such as small market size, landlocked location, and cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Botswana remains one of the best investment opportunities in the developing world.  Botswana has a 90-member American Business Council that accepts membership from American-affiliated companies.Due to its history and geography, Botswana has long had deep ties to the economy of South Africa.  The Africa Customs Union (SACU), comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa, dates from 1910, and is the worlds oldest customs union. Namibia joined in 1990. Under this arrangement,  South Africa has collected levies from customs, sales, and excise duties for all five members, sharing out proceeds based on each countries portion of imports.  The exact formula for sharing revenues and the decision-making authority over dutiesheld exclusively by the Government of South Africabecame increasingly controversial, and the members renegotiated the arrangement in 2001.  The new structure has now been formally ratified and a SACU Secretariat has been established in Windhoek, Namibia.  Following South Africas accession to the Trade Organization (WTO), Botswana also joined; many of the SACU duties are thus declining, making products from outside the area more competitive in Botswana. Currently the SACU countries and the U.S. are negotiating a free trade agreement. Botswana is currently also negotiating a free trade agreement with Mercosur and an Economic Partnership Agreement with the Union as part of SADC.File:Okavango11.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view over DeltaGaborone is host to the headquarters of the fourteen-nation African Development Community (SADC), a successor to the African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC, established in 1980), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid South Africa.  SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa.  SADCs Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1 September 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2008 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market.  SADCs failure to distance itself from the Mugabe government in Zimbabwe has diminished the number of opportunities for cooperation between the U.S. and SADC.Botswana has successfully carried an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour, which was adopted in the period 2006-2007. the Children delisted Botswana as a nation harbouring child-labour facilities in 2008.Financial SectorBotswana has a growing financial sector, and the countrys national stock market, the Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE), based in Gaborone, is given the responsibility to operate and regulate the equities and fixed interest securities market. Formally established in 1989, the BSE continues to be pivotal to Botswanas financial system, and in particular the capital market, as an avenue on which government, quasi-government and the private sector can raise debt and equity capital. Although the BSE has just under 40 companies listed, it plays host to the most pre-eminent companies doing business in Botswana. These companies represent a spectrum of industries and commerce, from Banking and financial services to Wholesaling and Retailing, Tourism and Information Technology.To date, the BSE is one of Africas best performing stock exchanges, averaging 24% aggregate return in the past decade. This has allowed the BSE to be the third largest stock exchange, in terms of market capitalization, in Southern Africa.Given Botswanas lack of exchange controls, stable currency and exceptionally performing stock market, the financial sector has attracted a host of global investors seeking better returns.Botswanas currency, the pula, is fully convertible and is valued against a basket of currencies heavily weighted toward the South African Rand.  Profits and direct investment can be repatriated without restriction from Botswana.  The Botswana Government eliminated all exchange controls in 1999.  The Central Bank devalued the Pula by 7.5% in February 2004 in a bid to maintain export competitiveness against the real appreciation of the Pula. There was a further 12% devaluation in May 2005 and the policy of a peg was adopted.The recently established Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) is responsible for the oversight of all non-banking financial services entities in the country. As of 2005, about 54 percent of Botswanas population had access to formal or informal financial services, and 43 percent is banked (with access to at least one formal banking product). The overall access ratio is still low, especially in rural areas, where there are 3.8 branches and 73 ATMs per 100,000 people. Mobile banking services have just started to be offered. In recent years the government and Central Bank have undertaken serious steps to modernize the countrys payment system infrastructure. These efforts included the establishment of a code-line clearing system for the exchange of cheques and electronic funds as well as a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, including SWIFT connection. The stock exchange implemented a Central Securities Depository in 2007. Remittance Flows for Botswana amounted to USD 117 million in 2007, a figure that is higher than the total net value of official development assistance.(MFW4A))Gaborone is host to the headquarters of the 14-nation African Development Community (SADC). A successor to the African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid in South Africa, SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa. SADCs Trade Protocol, which was launched on September 1, 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2012 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market. The Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA), which implements the U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) Initiative for Southern Africa (ISA), is headquartered in Gaborone as well.See also* Botswana* of Africa* of South Africa* of Botswana companies* of South African companies* AfricaReferencesExternal links**Botswana latest trade data on ITC Trade Map* MBendi Botswana overview* Debswana minede Botswanade Botsuanadu Botswanade BotsuanaBocvanedi Botswanade Botswanado BotswanaBocvane

Brazil covers a total area of  which includes  of land and  of water. The highest point in Brazil is da Neblina at . Brazil is bordered by the countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela. Much of the climate is tropical, with the south being relatively temperate. The largest river in Brazil, and one of the longest in the world, is the Amazon. The rainforest that covers the Basin constitutes almost half of the rainforests on Earth.Geographic coordinates:Size and locationWith its expansive territory, Brazil occupies most of the eastern part of the South American continent and its geographic heartland, as well as various islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The only countries in the world that are larger are Russia, Canada, the Peoples Republic of China, and the United States. The national territory extends  from north to south (51620 N to 334432 S latitude) and  from east to west (344730 W to 735932 W longitude). It spans three zones, the westernmost of which is one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time in the United States. The time zone of the capital (Braslia) and of the most populated part of Brazil along the east coast (UTC-3) is two hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, except when it is on its own saving time, from October to February. The Atlantic islands are in the easternmost time zone.Brazil possesses the archipelago of de Noronha, located  northeast of its horn, and several small islands and atolls in the Atlantic - Abrolhos, das Rocas, Penedos de So Pedro e So Paulo, Trindade, and Martim Vaz. In the early 1970s, Brazil claimed a territorial sea extending  from the countrys shores, including those of the islands.On Brazils east coast, the Atlantic coastline extends . In the west, in clockwise order from the south, Brazil has  of borders with Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and Guiana. The only South American countries with which Brazil does not share borders are Chile and Ecuador. A few short sections are in question, but there are no true major boundary controversies with any of the neighboring countries.It has within it five eco-systems, the tropical rainforest, the pantanal, the cerrado, the mata atlantica and the pampasn and surrounding areas. Geology, geomorphology and drainage In contrast to the Andes, which rose to elevations of nearly  in a relatively recent epoch and inverted the Amazons direction of flow from westward to eastward, Brazils geological formation is very old. Precambrian crystalline shields cover 36% of the territory, especially its central area. The principal mountain ranges average elevations just under . The do Mar Range hugs the Atlantic coast, and the do Espinhao Range, the largest in area, extends through the south-central part of the country. The highest mountains are in the Tumucumaque, Pacaraima, and Imeri ranges, among others, which traverse the northern border with the Guianas and Venezuela.In addition to mountain ranges (about 0.5% of the country is above ), Brazils Central Highlands include a vast central plateau (Central). The plateaus uneven terrain has an average elevation of . The rest of the territory is made up primarily of sedimentary basins, the largest of which is drained by the Amazon and its tributaries. Of the total territory, 41% averages less than  in elevation. The coastal zone is noted for thousands of kilometers of tropical beaches interspersed with mangroves, lagoons, and dunes, as well as numerous reefs.thumb|250px|Topographic map of BrazilBrazil has one of the worlds most extensive systems, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic Ocean. Two of these basinsthe Amazon and Tocantins-Araguaia account for more than half the total drainage area. The largest river system in Brazil is the Amazon, which originates in the Andes and receives tributaries from a basin that covers 45.7% of the country, principally the north and west. The main Amazon river system is the Amazonas-Solimes-Ucayali axis (the -long Ucayali is a Peruvian tributary), flowing from west to east. Through the Amazon Basin flows one-fifth of the worlds fresh water. A total of  of the Amazon are in Brazilian territory. Over this distance, the waters decline only about . The major tributaries on the southern side are, from west to east, the Javari, Juru, Purus (all three of which flow into the western section of the Amazon called the Solimes), Madeira, Tapajs, Xingu, and Tocantins. On the northern side, the largest tributaries are the Branco, Japur, Jari, and Rio Negro. The above-mentioned tributaries carry more water than the Mississippi (its discharge is less than one-tenth that of the Amazon). The Amazon and some of its tributaries, called white rivers, bear rich sediments and hydrobiological elements. The black-white and clear riverssuch as the Negro, Tapajs, and Xinguhave clear (greenish) or dark water with few nutrients and little sediment.The major river system in the Northeast is the Rio So Francisco, which flows  northeast from the south-central region. Its basin covers 7.6% of the national territory. Only  of the lower river are navigable for oceangoing ships. The Paran system covers 14.5% of the country. The Paran flows south among the de la Plata Basin, reaching the Atlantic between Argentina and Uruguay. The headwaters of the Paraguai, the Parans major eastern tributary, constitute the Pantanal, the largest contiguous wetlands in the world, covering as much as .Below their descent from the highlands, many of the tributaries of the Amazon are navigable. Upstream, they generally have rapids or waterfalls, and boats and barges also must face sandbars, trees, and other obstacles. Nevertheless, the Amazon is navigable by oceangoing vessels as far as  upstream, reaching Iquitos in Peru. The Amazon river system was the principal means of access until new roads became more important hydroelectric projects are Itaipu, in Paran, with 12,600 MW; Tucuru, in Par, with 7,746 MW; and Afonso, in Bahia, with 3,986 MW. Natural resources resources include: bauxite, gold, iron ore, manganese, nickel, phosphates, platinum, tin, uranium, petroleum, hydropower and timber. Rivers and lakes thumb|250px|Main Hydrographic Regions of BrazilAccording to organs of the Brazilian government there are 12 major hydrographic regions in Brazil. Seven of these are river basins named after their main rivers; the other five are groupings of various river basins in areas which have no dominant river.*7 Hydrographic Regions named after their dominant rivers:** Amazonas** Paraguai** Paran** Parnaba** So Francisco** Tocantins** Uruguai*5 coastal Hydrographic Regions based on regional groupings of minor river basins (listed from north to south):** Atlntico Nordeste Ocidental (Western North-east Atlantic)** Atlntico Nordeste Oriental (Eastern North-east Atlantic)** Atlntico Leste (Eastern Atlantic)** Atlntico Sudeste (South-east Atlantic)** Atlntico Sul (South Atlantic)The River is the widest and second longest river (behind the Nile) in the world. This huge river drains the greater part of the worlds rainforests. Another major river, the Paran, has its source in Brazil. It forms the border of Paraguay and Argentina, then winds its way through Argentina and into the Atlantic Ocean, along the southern coast of Uruguay. The HBV transport model has been used to analyze certain pollutant transport in Brazils river systems.The Amazon is full of eroded soil. Soils and vegetation thumb|250px|The Amazon RainforestBrazils tropical soils produce 70 million tons of grain crops per year, but this output is attributed more to their extension than their fertility. Despite the earliest Portuguese explorers reports that the land was exceptionally fertile and that anything planted grew well, the record in terms of sustained agricultural productivity has been generally disappointing. High initial fertility after clearing and burning usually is depleted rapidly, and acidity and aluminum content are often high. Together with the rapid growth of weeds and pests in cultivated areas, as a result of high temperatures and humidity, this loss of fertility explains the westward movement of the agricultural frontier and slash-and-burn agriculture; it takes less investment in work or money to clear new land than to continue cultivating the same land. Burning also is used traditionally to remove tall, dry, and nutrient-poor grass from pasture at the end of the dry season. Until mechanization and the use of chemical and genetic inputs increased during the agricultural intensification period of the 1970s and 1980s, coffee planting and farming in general moved constantly onward to new lands in the west and north. This pattern of horizontal or extensive expansion maintained low levels of technology and productivity and placed emphasis on quantity rather than quality of agricultural production.The largest areas of fertile soils, called terra roxa (red earth), are found in the states of Paran and Paulo. The least fertile areas are in the Amazon, where the dense forest is. Soils in the Northeast are often fertile, but they lack water, unless they are irrigated artificially.In the 1980s, investments made possible the use of irrigation, especially in the Northeast Region and in Grande do Sul State, which had shifted from grazing to soy and rice production in the 1970s. Savanna soils also were made usable for soybean farming through acidity correction, fertilization, breeding, and in some cases spray irrigation. As agriculture underwent modernization in the 1970s and 1980s, soil fertility became less important for agricultural production than factors related to capital investment, such as infrastructure, mechanization, use of chemical inputs, breeding, and proximity to markets. Consequently, the vigor of frontier expansion weakened.The variety of climates, soils, and drainage conditions in Brazil is reflected in the range of its vegetation types. The Amazon Basin and the areas of heavy rainfall along the Atlantic coast have tropical rain forest composed of broadleaf evergreen trees. The rain forest may contain as many as 3,000 species of flora and fauna within a  area. The Atlantic Forest is reputed to have even greater biological diversity than the Amazon rain forest, which, despite apparent homogeneity, contains many types of vegetation, from high canopy forest to bamboo groves.In the semiarid Northeast, caatinga, a dry, thick, thorny vegetation, predominates. Most of central Brazil is covered with a woodland savanna, known as the cerrado (sparse scrub trees and drought-resistant grasses), which became an area of agricultural development after the mid-1970s. In the South (Sul), needle-leaved pinewoods (Paran pine or araucaria) cover the highlands; grassland similar to the Argentine pampa covers the sea-level plains. The Mato Grosso swamplands (Pantanal Mato-grossense) is a Florida-sized plain in the western portion of the Center-West (Centro-Oeste). It is covered with tall grasses, bushes, and widely dispersed trees similar to those of the cerrado and is partly submerged during the rainy season.Brazil, which is named after reddish dyewood (brasil), has long been famous for the wealth of its tropical forests. These are not, however, as important to world markets as those of Asia and Africa, which started to reach depletion only in the 1980s. By 1996 more than 90% of the original Atlantic forest had been cleared, primarily for agriculture, with little use made of the wood, except for araucaria pine in Paran.The inverse situation existed with regard to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, and part of the remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per hectare, there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as mahogany and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of fires, which are otherwise rare in forests. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of Par State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of plywood have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.Starting in the late 1980s, rapid deforestation and extensive burning in Brazil received considerable international and national attention. images have helped document and quantify deforestation as well as fires, but their use also has generated considerable controversy because of problems of defining original vegetation, cloud cover, and dealing with secondary growth and because fires, as mentioned above, may occur in old pasture rather than signifying new clearing. Public policies intended to promote sustainable management of timber extraction, as well as sustainable use of nontimber forest products (such as rubber, nuts, fruits, seeds, oils, and vines), were being discussed intensely in the mid-1990s. However, implementing the principles of sustainable development, without irreversible damage to the environment, proved to be more challenging than establishing international agreements about them.Natural vegetation map of Brazil, 1977ClimateAlthough 90% of the country is within the zone, the climate of Brazil varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the equator traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to zones below the of Capricorn (2327 S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of So Paulo. Brazil has five climatic regions: equatorial, tropical, semiarid, highland tropical, and subtropical.Temperatures along the equator are high, averaging above , but not reaching the summer extremes of up to  in the temperate zones. There is little seasonal variation near the equator, although at times it can get cool enough for wearing a jacket, especially in the rain. At the countrys other extreme, there are frosts south of the Tropic of Capricorn during the winter (JuneAugust), and there is snow in the mountainous areas, such as Paran, Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Temperatures in the cities of So Paulo, Horizonte, and Braslia are moderate (usually between ), despite their relatively low latitude, because of their elevation of approximately . Rio de Janeiro, Recife, and Salvador on the coast have warm climates, with average temperatures ranging from , but enjoy constant trade winds. The southern cities of Alegre and Curitiba have a subtropical climate similar to that in parts of the United States and Europe, and temperatures can fall below freezing in winter.Precipitation levels vary widely. Most of Brazil has moderate rainfall of between  a year, with most of the rain falling in the summer (between December and April) south of the Equator. The region is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally more than  per year and reaching as high as  in parts of the western Amazon and near Belm. It is less widely known that, despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three- to five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.High and relatively regular levels of precipitation in the Amazon contrast sharply with the dryness of the semiarid Northeast, where rainfall is scarce and there are severe droughts in cycles averaging seven years. The Northeast is the driest part of the country. The region also constitutes the hottest part of Brazil, where during the dry season between May and November, temperatures of more than  have been recorded. However, the serto, a region of semidesert vegetation used primarily for low-density ranching, turns green when there is rain. Most of the Center-West has  of rain per year, with a pronounced dry season in the middle of the year, while the South and most of the year without a distinct dry season.Geographic regionsRegions.svg|thumb|250px|1  Central-West  2  Northeast  3  North  4  Southeast  5  Southernthumb|250px|right|The Brazilian states.Brazils 26 states and the Federal District (Distrito Federal) are divided conventionally into five regions: North (Norte), Northeast (Nordeste), Southeast (Sudeste), South (Sul), and Center-West (Centro-Oeste) - see fig. 4. In 1996 there were 5,581 municipalities (municpios), which have municipal governments. Many municipalities, which are comparable to United States counties, are in turn divided into districts (distritos), which do not have political or administrative autonomy. In 1995 there were 9,274 districts. All municipal and district seats, regardless of size, are considered officially to be urban. For purely statistical purposes, the municipalities were grouped in 1990 into 559 micro-regions, which in turn constituted 136 meso-regions. This grouping modified the previous micro-regional division established in 1968, a division that was used to present census data for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.Each of the five major regions has a distinct ecosystem. Administrative boundaries do not necessarily coincide with ecological boundaries, however. In addition to differences in environment, patterns of activity and population settlement vary widely among the regions. The principal ecological characteristics of each of the five major regions, as well as their principal socioeconomic and demographic features, are summarized below. Centerwest The Center-West consists of the states of Gois, Grosso, and Grosso do Sul (separated from Mato Grosso in 1979), as well as the District, site of Braslia, the national capital. Until 1988 Gois State included the area that then became the state of Tocantins in the North.The Center-West has  and covers 18.9% of the national territory. Its main biome is the cerrado, the tropical savanna in which natural grassland is partly covered with twisted shrubs and small trees. The cerrado was used for low-density cattle-raising in the past but is now also used for soybean production. There are forests along the rivers and streams and some larger areas of forest, most of which have been cleared for farming and livestock. In the north, the cerrado blends into tropical forest. It also includes the Pantanal wetlands in the west, known for their wildlife, especially aquatic birds and caymans. In the early 1980s, 33.6% of the region had been altered by anthropic activities, with a low of 9.3% in Mato Grosso and a high of 72.9% in Gois (not including Tocantins). In 1996 the Center-West region had 10.2 million inhabitants, or 6% of Brazils total population. The average density is low, with concentrations in and around the cities of Braslia, Goinia, Grande, and Cuiab. Living standards are below the national average. In 1994 they were highest in the Federal District, with per capita income of US$7,089 (the highest in the nation), and lowest in Mato Grosso, with US$2,268. Northeast The nine states that make up the Northeast are Alagoas, Bahia, Cear, Maranho, Paraba, Pernambuco, Piau, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe. The de Noronha archipelago (formerly the federal territory of de Noronha, now part of Pernambuco state) is also included in the Northeast.The Northeast, with , covers 18.3% of the national terrest concentration of rural population, and its living standards are the lowest in Brazil. In 1994 Piau had the lowest per capita income in the region and the country, only US$835, while Sergipe had the highest average income in the region, with US$1,958. North The equatorial North, also known as the Amazon or Amaznia, includes, from west to east, the states of Rondnia, Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Par, Amap, and, as of 1988, Tocantins (created from the northern part of Gois State, which is situated in the Center-West). Rondnia, previously a federal territory, became a state in 1986. The former federal territories of Roraima and Amap were raised to statehood in 1988.With , the North is the countrys largest region, covering 45.3% of the national territory. The regions principal biome is the humid forest, also known as the rain forest, home to some of the planets richest diversity. The North has served as a source of forest products ranging from backlands drugs (such as sarsaparilla, cocoa, cinnamon, and turtle butter) in the colonial period to rubber and nuts in more recent times. In the mid-twentieth century, nonforest products from mining, farming, and livestock-raising became more important, and in the 1980s the industry boomed. In 1990, 6.6% of the regions territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in Amap to 14.0% in Rondnia.In 1996 the North had 11.1 million inhabitants, only 7% of the national total. However, its share of Brazils total had grown rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s as a result of interregional migration, as well as high rates of natural increase. The largest population concentrations are in eastern Par State and in Rondnia. The major cities are Belm and Santarm in Par, and Manaus in Amazonas. Living standards are below the national average. The highest capita income, US$2,888, in the region in 1994, was in Amazonas, while the lowest, US$901, was in Tocantins. Southeast The Southeast consists of the four states of Santo, Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and So Paulo. Its total area of  corresponds to 10.9% of the national territory. The region has the largest share of the countrys population, 63 million in 1991, or 39% of the national total, primarily as a result of internal migration since the mid-19th century until the 1980s. In addition to a dense urban network, it contains the megacities of So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which in 1991 had 18.7 million and 11.7 million inhabitants in their metropolitan areas, respectively. The region combines the highest living standards in Brazil with pockets of urban poverty. In 1994 So Paulo boasted an average income of US$4,666, while Minas Gerais reported only US$2,833.Originally, the principal biome in the Southeast was the Atlantic Forest, but by 1990 less than 10% of the original forest cover remained as a result of clearing for farming, ranching, and charcoal making. Anthropic activity had altered 79.7% of the region, ranging from 75% in Minas Gerais to 91.1% in Esprito Santo. The region has most of Brazils industrial production. The state of So Paulo alone accounts for half of the countrys industries. Agriculture, also very strong, has diversified and now uses modern technology. South The three states in the temperate South: Paran, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarinacover , or 6.8% of the national territory. The population of the South in 1991 was 23.1 million, or 14% of the countrys total. The region is almost as densely settled as the Southeast, but the population is more concentrated along the coast. The major cities are Curitiba and Alegre. The inhabitants of the South enjoy relatively high living standards. Because of its industry and agriculture, Paran had the highest average income in 1994, US$3,674, while Santa Catarina, a land of small farmers and small industries, had slightly less, US$3,405.In addition to the Forest and moist forests, much of which were cleared in the post-World War II period, the southernmost portion of Brazil contains the savanna, which extends into Argentina and Uruguay. In 1982, 83.5% of the region had been altered by anthropic activity, with the highest level (89.7%) in Rio Grande do Sul, and the lowest (66.7%) in Santa Catarina. Agriculture--much of which, such as rice production, is carried out by small farmershas high levels of productivity. There are also some important industries.Environmental issuesThe environmental problem that attracted most international attention in Brazil in the 1980s was undoubtedly deforestation in the Amazon. Of all American countries, Brazil still has the largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but clearing and burning in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the clearing resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from and burn techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.Desertification, another important environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are severely degraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid caatinga ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.In areas where agriculture is more intense and developed, there are serious problems of erosion, siltation and sedimentation of streams and rivers, and pollution with pesticides. In parts of the savannas, where irrigated soybean production expanded in the 1980s, the table has been affected. Expansion of pastures for cattle raising has reduced natural biodiversity in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.In urban areas, at least in the largest cities, levels of pollution and congestion are typical of, or worse than, those found in cities in countries. At the same time, however, basic environmental problems related to the lack of sanitation, which developed countries solved long ago, persist in Brazil. These problems are sometimes worse in middle-sized and small cities than in large cities, which have more resources to deal with them. Environmental problems of cities and towns finally began to receive greater attention by society and the government in the 1990s.According to many critics, the crisis in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to overexploitation of resources, stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection. At the same time, however, the lower level of economic activity may have reduced pressure on the environment, such as the aforementioned decreased level of investment in large-scale clearing in the Amazon. That pressure could increase if economic growth accelerates, especially if consumption patterns remain unchanged and more sustainable forms of production are not found.In Brazil public policies regarding the environment are generally advanced, although their implementation and the enforcement of laws have been far from ideal. Laws regarding forests, water, and wildlife have been in effect since the 1930s. Brazil achieved significant institutional advances in environmental policy design and implementation after the Conference on the Environment in 1972. Specialized environmental agencies were organized at the federal level and in some states, and many parks and reserves were established. By 1992 Brazil had established 34 national parks and fifty-six reserves. In 1981 the National Environment Policy was defined, and the National System for the Environment (Sistema Nacional do Meio Ambiente--Sisnama) was created, with the National Environmental Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente--Conama) at its apex, municipal councils at its base, and state-level councils in between. In addition to government authorities, all of these councils include representatives of civil society.The constitution incorporates environmental precepts that are advanced compared with those of most other countries. At that time, the Chamber of Deputies (Cmara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities. In 1989 the creation of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renovveis--Ibama) joined together the federal environment secretariat and the federal agencies specializing in forestry, rubber, and fisheries. In 1990 the administration of Collor de Mello (president, 199092) appointed the well-known environmentalist Lutzemberger as secretary of the environment and took firm positions on the environment and on lands. In 1992 Brazil played a key role at the Summit, not only as its host but also as negotiator on sustainable development agreements, including the conventions on climate and biodiversity. The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the Amazon and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resourcesthe Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazonit began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources. In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function under the aegis of the Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan for the twenty-first century) for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.Institutional development at the official level was accompanied and in part stimulated by the growth, wide diffusion, and growing professional development of organizations (NGOs) dedicated to environmental and socio-environmental causes. The hundreds of NGOs throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and passionate criticisms. Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlntica), the Social-Environmental Institute (Instituto Scio-AmbientalISA), the Pro-Nature Foundation (Fundao Pr-NaturezaFunatura), and the Amazon Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho AmaznicoGTA). The Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations (Associaco Brasileira de Organizaes No-GovernamentaisABONG) are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well. The main international environmental NGOs that have offices or affiliates in Brazil are the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International (CI), and Nature Conservancy.Especially after the events of the late 1980s, international organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.Among the specific environmental projects with international support, the most important was the National Environmental Plan (Plano Nacional do Meio AmbientePNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio AmbienteFNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteo das Florestas Tropicais do BrasilPPG-7) was supported by the worlds seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondnia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.Despite favorable laws, promising institutional arrangements, and external funding, the government has not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it can be attributed to the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.Environment - current issues:deforestation in Amazon Basin destroys the habitat and endangers the existence of a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous to the area; air and water pollution in de Janeiro, So Paulo, and several other large cities; land degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activitiesnote:President Cardoso in September 1999 signed into force an environmental crime bill which for the first time defines pollution and deforestation as crimes punishable by stiff fines and jail sentencesEnvironment - international agreements:party to:Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whalingsigned, but not ratified:none of selected agreementsAntipodesParts of the Brazilian Amazon are antipodal to large areas of the Archipelago. This includes all of the Philippines apart from the northern end of Luzon, antipodal to southwestern Par and northwestern Grosso; most of Borneo, antipodal to northwestern Amazonas; much of Sulawesi, near the Guyanas (with Vista, Roraima not far from Kalumpang); and Halmahera, largely coinciding with the Brazilian state of Amap. The northernmost part of the coastal Brazil overlies half of Island. The small island nation of Palau is antipodal to southern Maranho near Balsas, and with Micronesian atolls such as Yap near Remanso, Bahia, Ulithi near Jaguarari, Bahia,, and Woleai near Grande, Paraba. The Japanese Okinawa and Islands stretch across the antipodes of Catarina State in the south of Brazil, while Brazils southernmost point partially overlaps the Korean island of Jeju. Numerous smaller western Pacific islands also find their antipodes in Brazil.References* *  Brasilgeografide Brasildu Brsildo BrasilBrazila geografijageografiBrazyliido Brasile BrazilitBrazilijemaantiedezh:

Its economy is the largest in American nations and the second largest in the western hemisphere.(Is Brazils Economy Getting Too Hot?) Brazil is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 5 percent. In Brazilian reais, its GDP was estimated at R$ 3.143 trillion in 2009. The Brazilian economy has been predicted to become one of the five largest economies in the world in the decades to come.(http://www.chicagobooth.edu/alumni/clubs/pakistan/docs/next11dream-march%2007-goldmansachs.pdf)Brazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as Mercosul, Unasul, G8+5, G20, WTO, and the Group. Its trade partners number in the hundreds, with 60 percent of exports mostly of manufactured or semimanufactured goods.( Brazils main trade partners in 2008 were: Mercosul and America (25.9 percent of trade), EU (23.4 percent), Asia (18.9 percent), the States (14.0 percent), and others (17.8 percent).(MDIC - Brazil Balance of Trade 2008)According to the Economic Forum, Brazil was the top country in upward evolution of competitiveness in 2009, gaining eight positions among other countries, overcoming Russia for the first time, and partially closing the competitiveness gap with India and China among the BRIC economies. Important steps taken since the 1990s toward fiscal sustainability, as well as measures taken to liberalize and open the economy, have significantly boosted the countrys competitiveness fundamentals, providing a better environment for private-sector development.(Global Competitiveness Report 2009-2010)The owner of a sophisticated technological sector, Brazil develops projects that range from submarines to aircraft and is involved in space research: the country possesses a satellite launching center and was the only country in the Hemisphere to integrate the team responsible for the construction of the Space Station (ISS).(Countries Participating in the ISS ISS EarthKam) It is also a pioneer in many fields, including ethanol production.Brazil, together with Mexico, has been at the forefront of the Latin American multinationals phenomenon by which, thanks to superior technology and organization, local companies have successfully turned global. These multinationals have made this transition notably by investing massively abroad, in the region and beyond, and thus realizing an increasing portion of their revenues internationally.(Brazil is also a pioneer in the fields of deep water oil research from where 73 percent of its reserves are extracted.( According to government statistics, Brazil was the first capitalist country to bring together the ten largest car assembly companies inside its national territory.(The annual Brasil Investment Summit (http://www.terrapinn.com/Conference/Brasil-Investment-Summit/) takes place in Paulo and is the largest gathering in Brazil of international investment experts covering opportunities in alternative vehicles, infrastructure, and advanced trading strategies.With still high levels of inequality, though it has diminished in the last years, the Brazilian economy has become one of the major economies of the world. According to Forbes 2011, Brazil has the 8th largest number of billionaires in the world, a number much larger than what is found in other American countries, and ahead of even Japan.() (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_the_number_of_US_dollar_billionaires)HistoryWhen the Portuguese explorers arrived in the 15th century, the native tribes of current-day Brazil, totaling about 2.5 million people, had lived virtually unchanged since the Age. From Portugals colonisation of Brazil (1500-1822) until the late 1930s, the market elements of the Brazilian economy relied on the production of products for exports. Within the Empire, Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial mercantile policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles - sugar, gold and, from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African enslaved labour until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African enslaved individuals in total). Since then, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth accompanied by mass immigration from Europe (mainly from Portugal, Italy, Spain and Germany) until the 1930s. In the Americas, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Canada (in descending order) were the countries that received most immigrants. In Brazils case, statistics show that 4.5 million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.Currently, with a population of 190 million and abundant resources, Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5 million television sets, and 3 million refrigerators. In addition, about 70 million cubic meters of petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundred petrochemicals. Furthermore, Brazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads and more than 93 Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity.Its real per capita GDP has surpassed US$ 10,500 in 2008, due to the strong and continued appreciation of the real for the first time this decade. Its industrial sector accounts for three fifths of the American economys industrial production.( The countrys scientific and technological development is argued to be attractive to direct investment, which has averaged US$ 30 billion per year the last years, compared to only US$ 2 billion per year last decade,(About Brazil Brazilian Government) thus showing a remarkable growth. The agricultural sector, locally called the agronegcio (agrobusiness), has also been remarkably dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil amongst the most highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector.( The agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which allowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to downturn in Western economies Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt the appreciation of the real.(Brazils Currency Wars - A Real Problem)Components of the economyThe service sector is the largest component of GDP at 66.8 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 29.7 percent (2007 est.). Agriculture represents 3.5 percent of GDP (2008 est.). Brazilian labor force is estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19 percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector. Agriculture and food production A performance that puts agribusiness in a position of distinction in terms of Brazils balance, in spite of trade barriers and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.(In the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew from 51 million to approximately 187 million inhabitants,(Popclock IBGE) an increase of over 2 percent per year. In order to meet this demand, it was necessary to take the development of cattle and crop raising activities a step further. Since then, an authentic green revolution has taken place, allowing the country to create and expand a complex agribusiness sector.( However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the Amazon.The importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the agricultural and cattle-raising plan and through another specific program geared towards family agriculture (Pronaf), which guarantee financing for equipment and cultivation and encourage the use of new technology, as shown by the use of agricultural land zoning. With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs. The special line of credit for women and young farmers is an innovation worth mentioning, providing an incentive towards the entrepreneurial spirit.(With The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the countrys objective is to provide suitable living and working conditions for over one million families who live in areas allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating two million jobs. Through partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government is working towards the guarantee of an infrastructure for the settlements, following the examples of schools and health outlets. The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.(thumb|left|Brazilian exports in 2006.Over 600,000 km of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of rural property; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the Central-western region (savanna), the Northern region (area of transition) and parts of the Northeastern region (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50 million tonnes.(In the bovine cattle-raising sector, the green ox, which is raised in pastures, on a diet of hay and mineral salts, conquered markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas, particularly after the mad cow disease scare period. Brazil has the largest cattle herd in the world, with 198 million heads,(Indicators Brazilian Government) responsible for exports surpassing the mark of US$ 1 billion/year.(A pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber cellulose, Brazil has also achieved positive results within the packaging sector, in which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is the world leader in soybean exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the planets orange juice, and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for beef and chicken, among the countries that deal in this sector.(Agriculture Brazilian Government) Industry {| width25% styletoc: 25em; font-size: 85%; lucida grande, sans-serif; text-align: left; classinfobox|-!aligncenter bgcolorlightblue colspan3|Industrial production|-200px|-! stylebackground:#f0f0f0; alignleft valigntop| Main industries| stylebackground:#f0f0f0; valigntop| Automobile industry, petrochemicals, machinery, electronics, cement and construction, aircraft, textiles, food and beverages, mining, consumer durables, tourism|-!alignleft valigntop|Industrial growth rate|valigntop| 8.8% (2008 est.)|-! stylebackground:#f0f0f0; alignleft valigntop|Labor force| stylebackground:#f0f0f0; valigntop| 21% of total labor force|-!alignleft valigntop|GDP of sector|valigntop| 29.7% of total GDP|-| aligncenter bgcolorlightblue colspan2||}Brazil has the second biggest industrial sector in the Americas.

During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazils financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. On May 8, 2008, the So Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) and the So Paulo-based Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F) merged, creating BM&FBOVESPA, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world.

Imports previously accounted for more than 70 percent of the countrys oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006. Brazil is one of the worlds leading producers of power, with a current capacity of about 260,000 megawatts. Existing power provides 90 percent of the nations electricity. Two large hydroelectric projects, the 19,900 megawatt Dam on the River (the worlds largest dam) and the Tucurui Dam in Par in northern Brazil, are in operation. Brazils first commercial reactor, I, located near de Janeiro, has been in operation for more than 10 years. II was completed in 2002 and is in operation too. An III has its planned inauguration scheduled for 2014. The three reactors would have combined capacity of 9,000 megawatts when completed.

In the 21st century, Brazil reached the status of 8th largest economy in the world. Originally, the export list was basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84 percent of exports consists of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.In the last decade, domestic production increased by 32.3 percent and agribusiness (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47 percent or 3.6 percent per year, was the most dynamic sector  even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy.(Sustainable growth Brazilian Government) The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called de Acelerao do Crescimento, aiming to spur growth.Brazils transparency ranking status in the international world is 75th according to International.(Transparency by country 2009) It is equal with Colombia, Peru and Suriname. Control and reform Among measures recently adopted in order to balance the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its security (state and retirement pensions) and Tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the Executive Branches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating windows of opportunity for local and international investors and producers.With these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it doesnt import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a crisis. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country wont be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.(Brazil and economic crisis)(Control and reform Brazilian Government) Consistent policies Support for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active and independent, Congress and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on Manufactured Products Tax (IPI), and the investment of $8 billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.The Policy for Industry, Technology and Trade, at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5 billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.(Consistent policies Brazilian Government) Mergers & Acquisitions Between 1993 and 2010, 7.012 mergers & acquisitions with a total known value of $707 billion USD with the involvement of Brazilian firms have been announced.(http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_Brazil) The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115 bn. of transactions.

Economy_of_Bulgaria
spelling        The economy of Bulgaria is an industrialised, market economy with a small public sector and advancing private sector. Bulgaria is an upper-middle-income country according to the Bank with a gross national income per capita of US$ 5,490 in 2008.()() Bulgaria is a member of Union, Trade Organization, and the Nations. Bulgaria has growing economy that attracts businesses with very competitive low taxes.( I capitali greci si rifugiano a Cipro ma le aziende preferiscono la Bulgaria, la Reputblica, 26 September 2011)(Bulgaria Keeps Faith In Low Taxes, Tax-News.com, 15 November 2010)HistoryThe economy declined dramatically during the 1990s with the collapse of the for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) system and the loss of the Soviet market, to which the country had been closely tied. The of living fell by about 40%, and only regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004. In addition, UN sanctions against Serbia (199295) and Iraq took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged when GDP grew 1.4% in 1994 for the first time since 1988, and 2.5% in 1995. Inflation, which surged in 1994 to 122%, fell to 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed due to an unstable and decentralised banking system, a wave of hyperinflation throughout several countries of Eastern Europe, and slow reforms, which led to an inflation rate of 311% and the collapse of the lev. When pro-reform forces came into power in the spring 1997, an ambitious economic reform package, including introduction of a currency board regime, was agreed to with the Monetary Fund and the Bank, and the economy began to stabilise. The 2000s saw a steady pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.Successful foreign direct investment and successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning have contributed greatly to the Bulgarian economy, with a historical growth rate average of 6% a year. Corruption in the public administration and a weak judiciary have continued to be long-term problems, and the presence of organized crime remains very high.A period of large trade deficits and improper real estate investment hit Bulgaria hard during the recession, resulting in a 12% GDP decline in that period, a rise in unemployment, and spending at least five quarters in its worst recession since the early 1980s.  However, this was not as severe compared to much of Europe. Future prospects are tied to the countrys increasingly important integration with the European Union member states. However, the country came out of a recession in 2010, and stagnated for a short period of time. It has been recently predicted that the economy would grow modestly by 2011. The country is expected to join the Eurozone in 2013.From the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in Europe in November 1989, the Communist Party (BCP) exerted complete economic, social and political control in Bulgaria. The partys ascent to power in 1944 had marked the beginning of economic change towards economy in Bulgaria. After World War II, Bulgaria followed the Soviet model of economic development more closely than any other East Bloc country with becoming one of the first members of Comecon; the new regime shifted the economy from mainly agrarian type towards economy and much of the labour force from the countryside to the city, providing workers for new large-scale industrial complexes. At the same time, the focus of Bulgarian international trade shifted from Central Europe to Eastern Europe and USSR.(William Marsteller. The Economy. Bulgaria country study (Glenn E. Curtis, editor). of Congress Research Division (June 1992).)(  ,     , . , 2008)These new policies resulted in impressive initial rates. Bulgarian economy closely resembled that of the Soviet Union. Soviet-style centralised planning in five-year blocks had more immediate benefits there than in the other European states where it was first applied in the early 1950s.(Economic policies) Throughout the postwar period, economic progress also was assisted substantially by a level of internal and external political stability unseen in other East European countries during the same period, that was also a change in Bulgarian political scene was a lot of turbulence preceded the ascent to power of BCP.(Nonetheless, beginning in the early 1960s low capital and labour productivity and expensive material inputs plagued the Bulgarian economy. With disappointing rates of growth came a high degree of economic experimentation. This experimentation took place within the socialist economic framework, however, and it never approached a market-based economy.(In the late 1980s, continuing poor economic performance brought new economic hardship. By that time, the misdirection and irrationality of BCP economic policies had become quite clear. Bulgarias economy contracted dramatically after 1987 with the dissolution of the Comecon, with which the Bulgarian economy had integrated closely. Finally, on 10 November 1989, at the November plenum of BCP Zhivkov was dismissed as a long-time party leader and head of state and the communist regime gave way to democratic elections and government. Unlike the communist parties in most other East European states, the BCP (changing its name to Socialist Party) retained majority power after the transition in Bulgaria by winning the first free national elections in June 1990. That was made possible by changes in party leadership, programme, reduction of its power base and other which permitted economic reorientation toward a market system.  This difficult transition combined with political vagueness, unpreparedness of people for the social and economic changes led to seriously worsen economic conditions during early 90s.( The standard of living fell with nearly 40% and more and regain levels in the beginning of 2000s.1990-2000The economy declined dramatically during the 1990s with the collapse of the Comecon system and the loss of the Soviet market, to which the country had been closely tied. The of living fell by about 40%, and only regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004. In addition, UN sanctions against Serbia (199295) and Iraq took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged when GDP grew 1.4% in 1994 for the first time since 1988, and 2.5% in 1995. Inflation, which surged in 1994 to 122%, fell to 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed due to the Bulgarian Socialist Partys slow and mismanaged economic reforms and an unstable and decentralised banking system, which led to an inflation rate of 311% and the collapse of the lev. When pro-reform forces came into power in the spring 1997, an ambitious economic reform package, including introduction of a currency board regime, was agreed to with the Monetary Fund and the Bank, and the economy began to stabilise. The 2000s saw a steady  pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.Reforms of the 1990s and early 2000sMembers of the government promised to move forward on cash and mass privatization upon taking office in January 1995 but were slow to act. Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia and Iraq (19902003), two of the countrys most significant trading partners, took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the GDP grew and inflation fell. The first round of mass privatisation finally began in January 1996, and auctions began toward the end of that year. The second and third rounds were conducted in Spring 1997 under a new government. In July 1998, the UDF-led government and the IMF reached agreement on a 3-year loan worth about $800 million, which replaced the 14-month stand-by agreement that expired in June 1998. The loan was used to develop financial markets, improve social safety net programmes, strengthen the tax system, reform agricultural and energy sectors, and further liberalise trade. The Commission, in its 2002 country report, recognised Bulgaria as a functioning market economy, acknowledging the progress made by Prime Minister Kostovs government toward market-oriented reforms.Rebound from the February 1997 crisisIn April 1997, the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) government won pre-term parliamentary elections and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of 1996 and 1997 has given way to an official growth, but forecasters are predicting accelerated growth over the next several years. The governments structural reform program includes: (a) privatization and, where appropriate, liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); (b) liberalization of agricultural policies, including creating conditions for the development of a land market; (c) reform of the countrys social insurance programs; and (d) reforms to strengthen contract enforcement and fight crime and corruption. Despite reforms, weak control over privatization led many successful state enterprises to bankruptcy. The UDF government also failed to stop the growing negative account balance, which has since then continued to increase, reaching a negative of $ 12.65 billion in 2008. The government elected in 2001 pledged to maintain the fundamental economic policy objectives adopted by its predecessor in 1997, specifically: retaining the Currency Board, implementing sound financial policies, accelerating privatisation, and pursuing structural reforms. Both governments failed to implement sound social policies.The economy really took off between 2003 and 2008 and growth figures quickly shot up, fluctuating between figures as high as 6.6% (2004) and 5.0% (2003). Even in the last pre-crisis year, 2008, the Bulgarian economy was growing rapidly at 6.0%, despite significantly slowing down in the last quarter.() Part of the European UnionOn 1 January 2007 Bulgaria entered the Union. This led to some immediate international trade liberalization, but there was no shock to the economy. The government is running annual surpluses of above 3%. This fact, together with annual GDP growth of above 5%, has brought the government indebtedness to 22.8% of GDP in 2006 from 67.3% five years earlier.() This is to be contrasted with enormous current account deficits. Low rates guaranteed availability of funds for investment and consumption. For example, a boom in the estate market started around 2003. At the same time annual inflation in the economy was variable and during the last five years (20032007) has seen a low of 2.3% and high of 7.3%.() Most importantly, this poses a threat to the countrys accession to the Eurozone. The government plans for the Euro to replace the Lev in 2010. However, experts predict that this might happen as late as in 2012.(http://capital.bg/showimg.php?filenameoo_330697.jpg List of projections for year of accession to the Monetary Union) From a political point of view, there is a trade-off between Bulgarias economic growth and the stability required for early accession to the union. Bulgarias per-capita PPP GDP is still only about a third of the EU25 average, while the countrys GDP per capita is about 13% of the EU25 average.Economic downturn following the international financial crisisright|thumb|GDP Growth (green vs. red) and Unemployment (blue) since 2001right|thumb|Public (dark red) vs. private (light red) foreign debt (red line)The country suffered a difficult start to 2009, after gas supplies were cut in the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. Industrial output suffered, as well as public services, exposing Bulgaria being overdependent on Russia for raw materials.The global financial crisis started to apply downward pressure on growth and employment in the last quarter of 2008. The real estate market, although not plummeting, ground to a halt and growth is expected to be significantly lower in the short-to-medium run.During the course of 2009, the grim forecasts for the effects of the global crisis on the Bulgarian economy largely materialized. Although suffering less than the worst-hit countries, Bulgaria recorded its worst economic results since the 1997 meltdown. GDP shrank by around 5% and unemployment jumped. Consumer spending and foreign investment dropped dramatically and depressed growth in 2010 to 0.3%. Unemployment remains stubbornly high around 10%. New Government and fiscal discipline The government of Borisov elected in 2009 undertook steps to restore economic growth, while attempting to maintain a strict financial policy.() The fiscal discipline set by Finance Minister Djankov proved successful and together with reduced budget spending it placed Bulgarian economy on the stage of steadily though slowly growing in the mids of world crisis. On December 1, 2009, Standard&Poors upgraded Bulgarias investment outlook from negative to stable, which made Bulgaria the only country in the Union to receive possitive upgrade that year.(Standard & Poors Upgrades Bulgarias Outlook to Stable) In January 2010 Moodys followed with an upgrade of its rating perspective from stable to positive.Bulgaria was expected to join the Eurozone in 2013 but after the rise of some instability in the zone Bulgaria is withholding its possitions towards the Euro, combining together possitive and realistic attitudes.(Bulgaria puts off Eurozone membership for 2015, BNR, July 26, 2011)(Euro Not a Hot Topic, Bulgarias Djankov Says, Bloomberg, Jul 25, 2011) Since Bulgarian lev is anyway bounded to Euro Bulgaria is looking for more possitive outcomes of the becoming a member of the Eurozone rather then risks.Economic Statistics*Economic StatisticsIndustriesIndustry and constructionMuch of Bulgarias communist-era industry was heavy industry, although biochemicals and computers were significant products beginning in the 1980s. Because Bulgarian industry was configured to Soviet markets, the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused a severe crisis in the 1990s. After showing its first growth since the communist era in 2000, Bulgarias industrial sector has grown slowly but steadily in the early 2000s. The performance of individual manufacturing industries has been uneven, however. Food processing and tobacco processing suffered from the loss of Soviet markets and have not maintained standards high enough to compete in Western Europe. Textile processing generally has declined since the mid-1990s, although clothing exports have grown steadily since 2000.(Oil refining survived the shocks of the 1990s because of a continuing export market and the purchase of the Burgas refinery by the Russian oil giant LUKoil. The chemical industry has remained in good overall condition but is subject to fluctuating natural gas prices. Growth in ferrous metallurgy, which is dominated by the Kremikovtsi Metals Combine, has been delayed by a complex privatization process and by obsolete capital equipment. Non-ferrous metallurgy has prospered because the Pirdop copper smelting plant was bought by Union Minire of Belgium and because export markets have been favourable.(The end of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the loss of Third World markets were grave blows to the defence industry. In the early 2000s, the industrys plan for survival has included upgrading products to satisfy Western markets and doing cooperative manufacturing with Russiancompanies. The electronics industry, which also was configured in the 1980s to serve Soviet markets, has not been able to compete with Western computer manufacturers. The industry now relies on contract agreements with European firms and attracting foreign investment. The automotive industry has ceased the manufacture of cars, trucks, and buses. Manufacture of forklifts, a speciality in the communist era, also has stopped. In the early 2000s, shipbuilding has prospered at the major Varna and Ruse yards because of foreign ownership (Ruse) and privatization (Varna).(Bulgaria country profile, p. 1011.)Only in recent years electronics and electric equipment production has regained higher levels. The largest centres include Sofia, Plovdiv and the surrounding area, Botevgrad, Zagora, Varna, Pravets and many other cities. appliances, computers, CDs, telephones, medical and scientific equipment are being produced.Many factories producing transportation equipment  still do not operate at full capacity. Plants produce trains (Burgas, Dryanovo), trams (Sofia), trolleys (Dupnitsa), buses (Botevgrad), trucks (Shumen), trucks (Plovdiv, Lom, Sofia, Lovech). Lovech has an automotive assembly plant. Rousse serves as the main centre for agricultural machinery. Bulgarian arms production mainly operates in central Bulgaria (Kazanlak, Sopot, Karlovo).Construction output fell dramatically in the 1990s as industrial and housing construction declined, but a recovery began in the early 2000s. The sector, now dominated by private firms, has resumed the foreign building programs that led to prosperity in the communist era. The Glavbolgostroy firm has major building projects in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine as well as domestic contracts.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 11.)EnergyBulgaria relies on imported oil and natural gas (most of which comes from Russia), together with domestic generation of electricity from coal-powered and hydro plants, and the Kozloduy nuclear plant. The economy remains energy-intensive because conservation practices have developed slowly. The country is a major regional electricity producer. Bulgaria produced 38.07 billion kWh of electricity in 2006(Photius.com, Electricity production as of 2006)(in comparison, Romania, which has a population nearly three times larger than Bulgaria, produced 51.7 billion kWh( in the same year). The domestic power-generating industry, which was privatized in 2004 by sales to interests from Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States, suffers from obsolete equipment and a weak oversight agency. To solve the latter problem, in 2008 the government set up a state-owned energy holding-company (Energy Holding EAD), composed of gas company Bulgargaz, Bulgartransgaz, power company EAD, Electricity System Operator EAD, Kozloduy nuclear power station, Maritza-Iztok II thermal power station, the Mini Maritza Iztok (Maritza Iztok mines), and Bulgartel EAD.  The state holds a 100% stake in the holding company.()() Most of Bulgarias conventional power stations will require large-scale modernization in the near future. Bulgaria has some 64 small hydroelectric plants, which together produce 19 percent of the countrys power output.(The Kozloduy nuclear plant, which in 2005 supplied more than 40 percent of Bulgarias electric power, will play a diminishing role because two of its remaining four reactors (two were closed in 2002) must be closed by 2007 to comply with European Union (EU) standards. Kozloduy, which exported 14 percent of its output in 2006, was expected to cease all exportation in 2007. Construction of the long-delayed Belene nuclear plant resumed in 2006 but will not be complete until at least 2011. Belene, planned in the 1980s but then rejected, was revived by the safety controversy at Kozloduy.(Oil exploration is ongoing offshore in the Black Sea (the Shabla block) and on the Romanian border, but Bulgarias chief oil income is likely to come as a transfer point on east-west and north-south transit lines. Burgas is Bulgarias main oil port on the Black Sea. Bulgarias largest oil refinery, Neftochim, was purchased by Russian oil giant LUKoil in 1999 and underwent modernization in 2005. Bulgarias only significant coal resource is low-quality lignite, mainly from the state-owned Maritsa-Iztok and Bobov Dol complexes and used in local thermoelectric power stations.(power stations (TPPs) provide a significant amount of energy, with most of the capacity concentrated in the Iztok Complex. The largest TPPs include:* Maritsa Iztok 2 - 1,450 MW* Varna - 1,260 MW* Maritsa Iztok 3 - 870 MW* Bobov Dol - 630 MW* Ruse Iztok - 600 MW* Maritsa Iztok 1 - 500 MWA $1.4 bln. project for the construction of an additional  block for the  Maritza Iztok 1 Thermal Power Station() is expected to be completed by the middle of 2010.Bulgaria ranks as a minor oil producer (97th in the world) with a total production of 3,520 bbl/day.(Oil producing countries rank table, CIA)Prospectors discovered Bulgarias first field near Tyulenovo in 1951. reserves amount to .gas production halted in the late 1990s. Proved reserves of natural gas amount to 5.663 bln. cu m.(Natural gas producing countries rank table, CIA) The LUKOIL Neftochim oil refinery is Bulgarias largest refining facility with annual revenues amounting to more than 4 billion leva (2 billion euro).(Lukoil Neftochim Tops Capital 100, Bank-bg.com, 18 June 2010) have seen a steady increase in electricity production from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.(EU Energy factsheet about Bulgaria) Wind energy has large-scale prospects, with up to 3,400 MW of installed capacity potential.(Bulgaria Renewable Energy Fact Sheet (EU))  Bulgaria operates more than 70 turbines with a total capacity of 112.6 MW, and plans to increase their number nearly threefold to reach a total capacity of 300 MW in 2010.(2010 .: 300     , profit.bg, June 28, 2009)Services and tourism Although the contribution of services to gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled in the post-communist era, a substantial share of that growth has been in government services, and the qualitative level of services varies greatly. The Bulgarian banking system, which was weak in the first post-communist years, was fully reformed in the late 1990s, including stronger oversight from the National Bank of Bulgaria and gradual privatisation. In 2003 the banking system was fully privatised, and substantial consolidation began making the system more efficient in 2004. Several smaller banks grew substantially between 2004 and 2006. These processes increased public confidence in the banks. Although the system still requires consolidation, loan activity to individuals and businesses increased in the early 2000s. The insurance industry has grown rapidly since a market reform in 1997, with the help of foreign firms. An example is the Bulgarian Insurance Group (BIG), a pension-fund and insurance management company owned by the Dutch-Israeli TBI Holding Company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The introduction of health and pension insurance plans has expanded the private insurance industry. A series of reform laws in the early 2000s enabled the Bulgarian Stock Exchange to begin regular operation. As of 2005, stock market activity was limited by lack of transparency, although the growth rate increased beginning in 2004.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 1112.)After a decline in the 1990s, in the early 2000s the tourism industry has grown rapidly. In 2004 some 4 million foreigners visited Bulgaria, compared with 2.3 million in 2000. This trend is based on a number of attractive destinations, low costs, and restoration of facilities. Most of the industry had been privatised by 2004. Infrastructure items such as recreation facilities and booking services require improvement. Development of Bulgarias retail sales sector was slow until the early 2000s, when a large number of Western-style outlets began to appear, and Sofia developed as a retail center. By 2006 several major European retail chains had opened stores, and others planned to enter the Bulgarian market.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 12.)Bulgaria has attracted considerable investment from foreigners buying property either for their own use or for investment.  In 2006, more than 29% of property deals were signed by foreigners, more than half of whom were UK citizens.(http://www.propertywisebulgaria.com/article/brits-form-the-majority-of-bulgarias--foreign-property-buyers/id_347/catid_12)  Various companies, such as Dreams, actively marketed Bulgarian properties to buyers overseas.In 2007 Bulgaria was visited by 5,200,000 tourists, ranking 39th in the world.(See Tourism rankings) Tourists from Greece, Romania and Germany account for 40% of visitors.(Statistics from the Bulgarian Tourism Agency) Significant numbers of British (+300,000), Russian (+200,000), Serbian (+150,000), Polish (+130,000) and Danish (+100,000) tourists also visit Bulgaria. Most of them are attracted by the varying and beautiful landscapes, well-preserved historical and cultural heritage, and the tranquility of rural and mountain areas.Main destinations include the capital Sofia, coastal resorts Albena, Sozopol, Vlas; winter resorts Pamporovo, Chepelare and Borovetz. Arbanasi and Bozhentsi are rural tourist destinations with well-preserved ethnographic traditions. Other popular attractions are the 10th century Monastery and the 19th century Euxinograd chteau.Agriculture, forestry, and fishingright|thumb|200px|Production of peachesIn the communist era, Bulgarias agriculture was heavily centralized, integrated with agriculture-related industries, and state-run. In the postcommunist era, the process of restoring agricultural land to private owners in a form that ensures productivity has been slow. Bank investment and insecurity in the land market contributed to slow development in the 1990s. By 2004 some 98 percent of the workforce and output of Bulgarias agricultural sector was private, including a number of large private cooperative enterprises. A significant amount of food also is produced for direct consumption by non-farmers on small plots, which are an important support for parts of the population. In 2000 and 2003, droughts limited agricultural production, and floods had the same effect in 2005. Bulgarias main field crops are wheat, corn, and barley. The main industrial crops are sugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are the most important vegetable exports. Production of apples and grapes, Bulgarias largest fruit products, has decreased since the communist era, but the export of wine has increased significantly. The most important types of livestock are cattle, sheep, poultry, pigs, and buffaloes, and the main dairy products are yogurt, cow and sheep cheese.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 9.) Bulgaria is the worlds 13th largest milk producer.(FAO - Bulgaria country rank)Image:Harvester DON IMG 4141.JPG|right|thumb|200px|harvester near Slivnitsa. About 43% of Bulgarias land is arable.In 2004 an estimated one-third of Bulgarias land mass was covered by forests, of which about 40 percent was conifers. Between 1980 and 2000, the forested area increased by 4.6 percent. In 2002 a total of 4,800 tons of timber was harvested, 44 percent of which was fuel wood and 20 percent, pulpwood. Although nominal state timber standards are very strict, in 2004 an estimated 45 percent of Bulgarias timber harvest was logged illegally because of corruption in the forest service. Some 7.5 percent of forests are protected from all uses, and 65 percent are designated for ecological and commercial use. In 2005 about 70 percent of the total forest resource was rated economically viable.(Since Bulgaria stopped high-seas fishing in 1995, the country has imported increasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon) has expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the Black Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase the take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased sharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic markets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, Bulgarias total fish harvest, wild and cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the harvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 10.)Production of the most important crops (according to the FAO) in 2006 (in 000 tons) amounted to: wheat 3301.9; sunflower 1196.6; maize 1587.8; grapes 266.2; tobacco 42.0; tomatoes 213.0; barley 546.3; potatoes 386.1; peppers 156.7; cucumbers 61.5; cherries 18.2; watermelons 136.0; cabbage 72.7; apples 26.1; plums 18.0; strawberries 8.8.Mining and mineralsBulgarias mining industry has declined in the post-communist era. Many deposits have remained underdeveloped because of a lack of modern equipment and low funding. Mining has contributed less than 2 percent of GDP and engaged less than 3 percent of the workforce in the early 2000s. Bulgaria has the following estimated deposits of metallic minerals: 207 million tons of iron ore, 127 million tons of manganese ore, 936 million tons of copper ore, 238 million tons of chromium ore, and 150 million tons of gold ore. Several of Bulgarias minerals are extracted commercially; 80 percent of mining is done by open-pit excavation. Iron extraction at Kremikovtsi and elsewhere is not sufficient to support the domestic steel industry, but copper, lead, and zinc deposits fully supply the nonferrous metallurgy industries. A British firm has exploratory gold mines at Dikanyite and Gornoseltsi, and a domestic copper and gold mine operates at Chelopech. About 50 nonmetallic minerals are present in significant amounts. Substantial amounts of uranium are present in the Rhodope Mountains, but no extraction has occurred in the last 10 years.(Despite the poor performance of the mining sector, productivity has increased in recent years. Mining remains one of the most important sources of export earnings and is still a significant contributor to economic growth. The mining industry is worth $760 mln,(Future of Bulgarian Mining Industry Looks Bright, novinite.com, 30 July 2010) and, along with related industries, employs 120,000 people.(http://thesofiaecho.com/2011/08/18/1141389_bulgarias-ore-exports-rise-10per-cent-in-h1-2011-industry-group) As of 2010 Bulgaria ranks as the 19th largest coal producer in the world,(See of countries by coal production.) 9th largest bismuth producer,(See of countries by bismuth production) 19th largest copper producer,(See of countries by copper mine production) and the 26th largest zinc producer.(See of countries by zinc production)The Elatsite copper mine and reprocessing facility, built during Chervenkovs rule, takes its place as one of the largest in South-Eastern Europe. It extracts 13 million tonnes of ore annually, producing about 42,000 tonnes of copper, 1.6 tonnes of gold and 5.5 tonnes of silver.(- , Geotechmin group)Ferrous metallurgy has major importance. Much of the production of steel and iron takes place in Kremikovtsi and Pernik, with a third metallurgical base in Debelt. In production of steel and steel products per capita the country heads the Balkans.  the fate of Kremikovtsi steel factories has come under debate because of serious pollution in the capital, Sofia.The largest refineries for lead and zinc operate in Plovdiv (the biggest refinery between Italy and the Ural mountains), Kardzhali and Iskar; for copper in Pirdop and Eliseina (now defunct); for aluminium in Shumen. In production of many metals per capita, such as zinc and iron, Bulgaria ranks first in Europe.LabourIn 2005 the labour force was estimated at 3.3 million; in 2004, 11 percent worked in agriculture, 33 percent in industry, and 56 percent in services. The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-communist era, reaching a high point of 19 percent in 2000. Since then, the rate has decreased substantially with the creation of new jobs in private and state enterprises. In 2005 the official figure was 11.5 percent, compared with 16.9 percent at the end of 2002. However, in 2003 an estimated 500,000 Bulgarians were unemployed but not officially counted because they were not seeking work. In January 2005, the government raised the minimum wage by 25 percent, to US$90 per month. The largest labour unions are Podkrepa (Support) and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. They represent labour in the National Council for Tripartite Partnership, in which they join government and business representatives to discuss issues of labour, social security, and living standards. The unions were an important political force in the fall of the Zhivkov regime.(Currency and inflationBulgarias unit of currency is the lev (pl., leva). In October 2006, the U.S. dollar was worth 1.57 leva. In 1999 the value of the lev was pegged to that of the German deutsch-mark, which was replaced by the euro in 2001. Following Bulgarias  admission to the European Union, the lev is scheduled to be replaced by the euro.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 14.)In 2003 Bulgarias inflation rate was estimated at between 2.3 and 3 percent. The rate was 6 percent in 2004 and 5 percent in 2005.(Taxation and government budgetAs of 1 January 2008 the tax for all citizens is set to a flat rate of 10%. This tax is one of the lowest income rates in the world and the lowest income rate in the Union.(http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/12/17/bulgaria-now-an-official-member-of-the-flat-tax-club/) The reform was done in pursue for higher GDP growth and greater tax collection rates. Some called it a revolution in taxation, but the changes were met with mild discussions and some protests by affected working classes. The proposal was modified to allow for compensating the perceived losers from the changes in the tax formula. The income tax is also 10% as of 1 January 2007 which is also among the lowest in Europe.(http://www.eubusiness.com/Bulgaria/1191900721.97/) Currently this taxation is kept while other countries highered their taxes during the crisis.For 2005 Bulgarias estimated state revenues totaled US$11.2 billion, and its estimated state expenditures, including capital expenditures, were US$10.9 billion, yielding a surplus of US$300 million. In 2004 revenues totaled US$10.1 billion and expenditures US$9.7 billion, for a surplus of US$400 million.(Foreign economic relationsIn the 1990s, Bulgaria moved gradually away from dependence on markets in the former Soviet sphere, increasing its exports to the European Union (EU). In 1999 Bulgaria joined the Central European Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA), with whose members (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia; Macedonia was added in 2006) it has established important trade relations. The admission of all but Croatia and Romania to the EU in 2004 reduced the significance of CEFTA trade, however. In 2004 some 54 percent of Bulgarias import trade and 58 percent of its export trade was with EU member countries. Bulgaria has bilateral free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, and Turkey.(In the early 2000s, hydrocarbon fuels remained an important import, although beginning in the late 1990s those commodities share of total imports decreased significantly, from 29 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 2004. During that period, the diversification of imported productsimproved as the volume of machinery and equipment, consumer products, and automobiles increased. A large percentage of imports is accounted for by raw materials such as cloth, metal ore, and petroleum, which are processed and re-exported. The most important imports in 2005 were machinery and equipment, metals and ores, chemicals and plastics, fuels, and minerals. The major sources of imports, in order of volume, were Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Greece. In 2005 Bulgarias largest export markets, in order of volume, were Italy, Germany, Turkey,Greece, and Belgium. The most important export commodities were clothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and fuels. In 2005 Bulgarias exports totaled US$11.7 billion and its imports totaled US$15.9 billion, incurring a trade deficit of US$4.2 billion. The trade deficit is especially severe with Russia, where markets for Bulgarian goods have shrunk drastically in the early 2000s.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 12-13.)In the first half of 2006, Bulgaria had a current account deficit of US$2.3 billion, a substantial increase over the deficit for the same period of 2005, which was some US$1.4 billion. Its trade deficit was US$2.78 billion, foreign direct investment totaled US$1.8 billion, and the financial account balance was US$2.29 billion. In mid-2006 the overall balance of payments was US$883 million, compared with US$755 million for the same period of 2005.(Bulgaria country profile, p. 13.)Bulgarias large foreign debt has been an economic burden throughout the postcommunist era. At the end of 2005, Bulgaria reported an external debt of US$15.2 billion, an increase in value but a decrease as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 2002 and previous years. As a percentage of GDP, the external debt remained constant between 2004 and 2005.(Beginning in the late 1990s, investment from the West and from Russia has contributed significantly to recovery from the economic crisis of 199697, but the rate of investment has remained lower than that in other countries of Eastern Europe. In 2003 the largest national sources of foreign direct investment, in order of volume, were Austria, Greece, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1997 the Belgian Solve company bought the Deny Soda Combine, and in 1999 LUKoil of Russia bought the Neftochim Oil Refinery at Burgas. Union Minire, a Belgian mining company, bought the large Pirdop copper-smelting plant, giving an important boost to Bulgarian nonferrous metallurgy. A number of foreign companies have invested in the chemical fertilizer and food-processing industries In the early 2000s, China invested in the Bulgarian electronics industry. Some cooperative agreements have been made for manufacture of vehicle components. Daimler-Chrysler of Germany has a contract to update Bulgarias military transport vehicles between 2003 and 2015. The French Eurocopter company has a bilateral protocol involving a variety of machinery, computer software, and other industrial products. In 2004 Bulgarian oil reserves attracted interest from Melrose Resources of Edinburgh. Russias natural gas giant, Gazprom, has pledged investment in Bulgarias natural gas infrastructure in exchange for increased purchase of its product. A three-company Israeli consortium agreed in 2004 to work with the domestic Overgas company (which is half-owned by Gazprom) on a major natural-gas distribution network in Bulgaria. In 2005 three European consortia submitted bids for construction of the Belene nuclear power plant. One such investor is the Italian ENEL energy consortium, which also owns the MaritsaIztok3 thermal power plant. In 2006 Russias Gazprom company bid against several European energy companies for ownership of newly privatized regional heating utilities, and the Austrian Petromaxx Energy Group invested US$120 million in a new oil refinery at Silistra.(In December 1996, Bulgaria joined the Trade Organization. In the early 90s Bulgarias slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept foreign investment among the lowest in the region. Total direct foreign investment from 1991 through 1996 was $831 million. In the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone over 2.72 billion Euro (3.47 billion US dollars) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005 economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euros (2.3 billion US dollars) in FDI which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies. After joining the EU in 2007 Bulgaria registered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 billion euros.Miscellaneous dataHouseholds with access to fixed and mobile telephone access(IT and telecommunications in Central and Eastern Europe  )* landline telephone - 62% (2009)* mobile telephone - 78% (2009) Broadband penetration rate(IT and telecommunications in Central and Eastern Europe  )* fixed broadband- 13.0% (2010) * mobile broadband- 1.3% (2010) Individuals using computer and internet(IT and telecommunications in Central and Eastern Europe  )* computer - 47% (2009)* internet - 45% (2009) See also*National Bank*Stock ExchangeReferences15px|link|alt This article incorporates public domain material Bulgaria country profile (October 2006) from websites or documents of the of Congress Research Division.External links* CIA World Factbook* Tax rates and tax revenue Bulharskade Bulgariade la Bulgariede Bulgariadi Bulgariavan Bulgarijede BulgariaBugariida Bulgriae Bullgarisekonomit Bungaryzh:

Economy_of_Burkina_Faso
spelling        Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world with an average income per capita of 250 (US$300). More than 80 percent of the population relies on agriculture, with only a small fraction directly involved in industry and services. Highly variable rainfall, poor soils, lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure, a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. The export economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.The country has a high population density, few resources, and a fragile soil. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its macroeconomic progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.The Burkinab financial system represents 30 percent of the countrys GDP and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90 percent of total financial system assets. Eleven banks and five non-bank financial institutions operate in the country.The banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60 percent of total financial sector assets. Banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.As of 2007, the World Bank estimated that 26 percent of the Burkinab population has access to financial services. The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) reports that about 41 microfinance institutions (MFIs) operate in the country, serving a total of 800,000 customers. Burkina Faso is a member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeurs Mobilires (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. As of 2009, the regional stock exchanges market capitalization reached nearly 10 percent of Burkina Fasos GDP.(MFW4A)Burkina Faso was ranked the 111th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.()Macro-economic trendThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Burkina Faso at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of CFA Francs.For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 470.70 CFA Francs only. Mean wages were $0.56 per manhour in 2009.Current GDP per capita(Earthtrends data) of Burkina Faso grew 13 percent in the Sixties reaching a peak growth of 237 percent in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 23 percent in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 37 percent in the Nineties. Average wages in 2007 hover around 2 to 3 dollars per day.Although handicapped by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy, Burkina remains committed to the adjustment program it launched in 1991. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in January 1994, with a 1996 growth rate of 5.9 percent.Many Burkinab migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their remittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Burkina is attempting to improve the economy by developing its mineral resources, improving its infrastructure, making its agricultural and livestock sectors more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and prices of cereals.The agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. The Plateau in north central Burkina faces encroachment from the Sahara. The resultant southward migration means heightened competition for control of very limited resources south of the Mossi Plateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as subsistence farmers, living with problems of climate, soil erosion, and rudimentary technology. The staple crops are millet, sorghum, maize, and rice. The cash crops are cotton, groundnuts, karite (shea nuts), and sesame. Livestock, once a major export, has declined.See also*in Burkina FasoExternal tradethumb|left|Burkinab exports in 2006Industry, still in an embryonic stage, is located primarily in Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou, Banfora, and Koudougou. Manufacturing is limited to food processing, textiles, and other import substitution heavily protected by tariffs. Some factories are privately owned, and others are set to be privatized. Burkinas exploitable natural resources are limited, although a manganese ore deposit is located in the remote northeast. Gold mining has increased greatly since the mid-1980s and, along with cotton, is a leading export moneyearner.References*External links**West African Agricultural Market Observer/Observatoire du March Agricole  (RESIMAO), a project of the West-African Market Information Network (WAMIS-NET),  provides live market and commodity prices from fifty seven regional and local public agricultural markets across Benin, Burkina Faso, Cte dIvoire, Guinea, Niger, Mali, Senegal, Togo, and Nigeria.

Economy_of_Burundi
spelling    Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The mainstay of the Burundian economy is agriculture, accounting for 54%of GDP in 1997. Agriculture supports more than 70% of the labour force, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers. Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, the ongoing civil war, overpopulation, and erosion have contributed to the contraction of the economy by 25% in recent years. Large numbers of displaced persons have been unable to produce their own food and are largely dependent on international humanitarian assistance. Burundi is a net food importer, with food accounting for 17% of imports in 1997.AgricultureThe main crop of Burundi is coffee, which accounted for 78.5% of exports in 1997. This dependence on coffee has increased Burundis vulnerability to seasonal yields and international coffee prices.It generates about 90 percent of export revenues, making the country particularly vulnerable to terms of trade shocks: the current account deficit in 2007 ran at 15 percent of GDP.(MFW4A) Coffee is the largest state-owned enterprise. In recent years, the government has tried to attract private investment to this sector, with some success. Efforts to privatize other publicly held enterprises have stalled. Other principal exports include tea and raw cotton. Burundi is the largest banana market in Africa.IndustryLittle industry exists except the processing of agricultural exports. Although potential wealth in petroleum, nickel, copper, and other natural resources is being explored, the uncertain security situation has prevented meaningful investor interest. Industrial development also is hampered by Burundis distance from the sea and high transport costs. Tanganyika remains an important trading point. The trade embargo, lifted in 1999, negatively impacted trade and industry. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 people and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short supply.Burundi is heavily dependent on bilateral and multilateral aid, with external debt totalling $1.247 billion (1.247 G$) in 1997. A series of largely unsuccessful 5-year plans initiated in July 1986 in partnership with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund attempted to reform the foreign exchange system, liberalize imports, reduce restrictions on international transactions, diversify exports, and reform the coffee industry.thumb|200px|left|Goat rearing has been promoted as a source of income for rural-dwelling Burundians.IMF structural adjustment programs in Burundi were suspended following the outbreak of the crisis in 1993. The World Bank has identified key areas for potential growth, including the productivity of traditional crops and the introduction of new exports, light manufactures, industrial mining, and services. Other serious problems include the states role in the economy, the question of governmental transparency, and debt reduction.To protest the 1996 coup by President Buyoya, neighbouring countries imposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never officially ratified by the Nations Security Council, most countries refrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the States also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi. The regional embargo was lifted on January 23, 1999, based on progress by the government in advancing national reconciliation through the Burundi peace process.References*ReferencesExternal links**Burundi latest trade data on ITC Trade Mapde Burundide Burundidu Burundide Burundidi Burundide BurundiBurundido Burundi

Boron
Boron () is the element with number 5 and the chemical symbol B. Boron is a metalloid. Because boron is not produced by nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in both the solar system and the Earths crust. However, boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporate ores, such as borax and kernite.Chemically uncombined boron is not found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure isolated boron is produced with difficulty, as boron tends to form refractory materials containing small amounts of carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder and crystalline boron is black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on Mohs scale), and a poor conductor at room temperature. Elemental boron is used as a dopant in the industry.The major industrial-scale uses of boron compounds are in perborate bleaches, and the borax component of fiberglass insulation. Boron polymers and ceramics play specialized roles as high-strength lightweight structural and refractory materials. Boron compounds are used in silica-based glasses and ceramics to give them resistance to shock. Boron-containing reagents are used for the synthesis of organic compounds, as intermediate in the synthesis of fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used, or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods and are used as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and a natural boron-containing organic antibiotic is known. Boron is essential to life. Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron necessary in soils. Experiments indicate a role for boron as an element in animals, but the nature of its role in animal physiology is unknown.History and etymologyThe name boron originates from the Arabic word  buraq or the Persian word  burah;() which are names for the mineral borax.()Boron compounds were known thousands of years ago. Borax was known from the deserts of western Tibet, where it received the name of tincal, derived from the Sanskrit. Borax glazes were used in China from AD300, and some tincal even reached the West, where the Arabic alchemist ibn Hayyn seems to mention it in 700. Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with mainly medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, at which date American sources replaced it.((  Boron compounds were relatively rarely used chemicals until the late 1800s when Marion Smiths Coast Borax Company first popularized these compounds and made them in volume and hence cheap (Hildebrand, G. H. (1982) Borax Pioneer: Francis Marion Smith. San Diego: Howell-North Books. p. 267 ISBN 0-8310-7148-6)Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir Davy() and by Louis Gay-Lussac and Jacques Thnard(Gay Lussac, J.L. and Thenard, L.J. (1808)  Sur la dcomposition et la recomposition de lacide boracique, Annales de chimie Annales de chemie et de physique, vol. 68, pp. 169174.) In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes. In his subsequent experiments he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named  the element boracium.( Gay-Lussac and Thnard use iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. They showed by oxidizing boron with air that boric acid is a oxidation product of boron.(()  Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824.(Berzelius produced boron by reducing a borofluoride salt; specifically, by heating potassium borofluoride with potassium metal. See:  Berzelius, J. (1824) Underskning af flusspatssyran och dess mrkvrdigaste freningar (Part 2) (Investigation of hydrofluoric acid and of its most noteworthy compounds), Kongliga Vetenskaps-Academiens Handlingar (Proceedings of the Royal Science Academy), vol. 12, pp. 46-98; see especially pp. 88ff.  Reprinted in German as:  Berzelius, J. J. (1824) Untersuchungen ber die Fluspathsure und deren merkwrdigste Verbindungen, Poggendorffs Annalen der Physik und Chemie, vol. 78, pages 113-150.) Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.()(()CharacteristicsAllotropesBoron is similar to carbon in its capability to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without order.()() Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point of above 2000 C. It exists in four major polymorphs: , ,  and T. Whereas ,  and T phases are based on B12 icosahedra, the -phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs.() It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 1220 GPa and heating to 15001800 C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 18002200 C. As to the  and  phases, they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the  phase being more stable.(()() Compressing boron above 160 GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 612 K.()Chemistry of the elementElemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies on boron involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. Chemically, boron behaves more closely to silicon than to aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated peroxide, hot concentrated acid, hot acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and acids.()()The rate of oxidation of boron depends upon the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form trioxide::4 B + 3 O2  2 B2O3File:Tetraborate-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|Ball-and-stick model of tetraborate anion, B4O5(OH)42, as it occurs in crystalline borax, Na2B4O5(OH)48H2O. Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp2 with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp3, each carrying a formal charge of 1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides, for example::2 B + 3 Br2  2 BBr3These trihalides in practice are usually made from the oxides.Chemical compoundsIn its most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are acids in that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called bases. For example, fluoride (F-) and trifluoride (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4-. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form acid.Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. The more than one hundred borates all feature boron in oxidation state +3. These mineral resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never feature boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate centers is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.  The nitrides are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They adopt structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the base to a bond to the acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively-charged boron and negatively-charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently graphite and h-BN have very different properties: both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar direction.Organoboron chemistryA large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in synthesis. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, tetraphenylborate (B(C6H5)4-) vs triphenylborane (B(C6H5)3). Many are produced from hydroboration, which employs diborane (B2H6).Compounds of B(I) and B(II)File:Boron-trifluoride-pi-bonding-2D.png|100px|thumb|Boron (III) trifluoride structure, showing empty boron p orbital in pi-type covalent bondsAlthough these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, is not isolable in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.()Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, feature boron in oxidation state less than III. Illustrative is diboride (MgB2). Each boron has a formal 1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of 2+.In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar, with an extra double bond for each boron, with the boron atoms forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite. However, unlike the case with hexagonal boron nitride which by comparison lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in the plane of magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In addition, in 2001 this material was found to be a high-temperature superconductor. Certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B12H122-), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds feature boron with coordination numbers greater than four.IsotopesBoron has two naturally occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of 11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from 16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through emission and decay. It has a half-life of 3.51022 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and tetrahydroxyborate|B(OH)4. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the 10B(OH)4 ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an signature.() The exotic 17B exhibits a halo, i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model.()The 10B isotope is good at capturing neutrons. Natural boron is about 20% 10B and 80% 11B. The nuclear industry enriches natural boron to nearly pure 10B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure 11B.Commercial isotope enrichmentBecause of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.() Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed, however only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the ether adduct of trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.()(see  showing an enrichment from 18% to above 94%.)Enriched boron (boron-10)Enriched boron or 10B is used in both radiation shielding and in neutron capture therapy. In the latter, a compound containing 10B is attached to a muscle near a tumor. The patient is then treated with a relatively low dose of thermal neutrons. This causes energetic and short range alpha radiation from the boron to bombard the tumor.()()()(http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/boron-neutron-capture-therapy-overview)In nuclear reactors, 10B is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function in the form of borosilicate rods or as acid. In water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.()In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.()Depleted boron (boron-11)radiation will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in 10B, if it is present in the spacecrafts semiconductors, producing a ray, an particle, and a lithium ion. These resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor chip structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or event upset). In hardened semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use depleted boron which is greatly enriched in 11B and contains almost no 10B. 11B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a by-product of the nuclear industry.(11B is also a candidate as a fuel for fusion. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500 keV, it produces three alpha particles and 8.7 MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long term radioactivity thereby endangering operating personnel. Whereas, the particles from 11B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.()NMR spectroscopyBoth 10B and 11B possess spin. The nuclear spin of 10B is 3 and that of 11B is 3/2. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The 10B and 11B nuclei also cause splitting in the resonances of attached nuclei.()OccurrenceBoron is a relatively rare element in the Earths crust, representing only 0.001%. The worldwide commercial borate deposits are estimated at 10 million tonnes.()()Turkey and the States are the worlds largest producers of boron.()() Turkey has almost 72% of the worlds boron reserves.() Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form but is found combined in borax, acid, colemanite, kernite, ulexite and borates. Boric acid is sometimes found in volcanic spring waters.Ulexite is one of over a hundred minerals; it is a fibrous crystal where individual fibers can guide light like optical fibers.()Economically important sources of boron are rasorite (kernite) and tincal (borax ore). They are both found in the Desert of California, but the largest borax deposits are in Central and Western Turkey including the provinces of Eskiehir, Ktahya and Balkesir.()()()ProductionThe production of boron compounds does not involve formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.The earliest routes to elemental boron involved reduction of oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal borides. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron, for the use in semiconductor industry, is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the melting or processes.()Market trendEstimated global consumption of boron rose to a record 1.8 million tonnes of B2O3 in 2005, following a period of strong growth in demand from Asia, Europe and North America. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved towards the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content. The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g.()Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Eti Mine Company of Turkey opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (borax) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.()()The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in fiberglass and borosilicate production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Asia with a consequent increase in demand for borates has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.(()ApplicationsNearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into acid and sodium tetraborate pentahydrate. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.()()Glass and ceramicsBorosilicate glass, which is typically 1215% B2O3, 80% SiO2, and 2% Al2O3, has a low of thermal expansion giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. Duran and Pyrex are two major brand names for this glass, used both in glassware and in consumer and bakeware, chiefly for this resistance.()Boron filaments are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and rods.()() The fibers can be produced by vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament.(()Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser-assisted vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (modulus 450 GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17 GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.()Detergent formulations and bleaching agentsBorax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products,() including the well-known Mule Team Borax laundry booster and Boraxo powdered hand soap. It is also present in some bleaching formulas.(perborate serves as a source of oxygen in many detergents, detergents, products, and laundry bleaches.  However, despite its name, Borateem laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using percarbonate instead as a bleaching agent.InsecticidesBoric acid is used as an insecticide, notably against ants, fleas, and cockroaches.()SemiconductorsBoron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon, germanium, and carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after 1970s, it was mostly replaced by implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source.() Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for etching of metals and their oxides.() Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.()MagnetsBoron is a component of magnets (Nd2Fe14B), which are the strongest type of permanent magnet. They are found in a variety of domestic and professional electromechanical and electronic devices, such as resonance imaging (MRI), various motors and actuators, computer HDDs, CD and DVD players, mobile phones, timer switches, speakers, and so on.()High-hardness and abrasive compoundsSeveral boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. Metal borides are used for coating tools through vapor deposition or vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through implantation or beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.()Boron carbidecarbide is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B2O3 with carbon in the electric furnace::2 B2O3 + 7 C  B4C + 6 COBoron carbides stucture is only approximately B4C, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon as the suggested C3 units are replaced with B-C chains, and there are smaller (B6) octahedra present as well. (See the article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, vests, and numerous other structural applications. Boron carbides ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.()Other superhard boron compounds*Heterodiamond (also called BCN);*nitride. This material is isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon,() is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller, but chemical stability is superior to that of diamond.*diboride can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of carbide, carbide, diboride or diboride.(*AlMgB14 + TiB2 composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.()Shielding in nuclear reactorsBoron shielding is used as a control for reactors, taking advantage of its high cross-section for neutron capture.Other nonmedical uses*Because of its distinctive green flame, amorphous boron is used in pyrotechnic flares.()*Starch and casein-based adhesives contain sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na2B4O710 H2O)*Some anti-corrosion systems contain borax.()*Sodium borates are used as a flux for soldering silver and gold and with chloride for welding ferrous metals.() They are also fire retarding additives to plastics and rubber articles.()*acid (also known as orthoboric acid) H3BO3 is used in the production of textile fiberglass and panel displays (() and in many PVAc and PVOH based adhesives.*Triethylborane is a substance which ignites the JP-7 fuel of the & Whitney J58 turbojet/ramjet engines powering the Lockheed Blackbird.() It was also used to ignite the F-1 Engines on the V Rocket utilized by NASAs Apollo and Skylab programs from 1967 until 1973. Triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially the fact that it burns with a very high temperature.() Triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures.Research areasdiboride is an important superconducting material with the transition temperature of 39 K. MgB2 wires are produced with the powder-in-tube process and applied in superconducting magnets.()()Amorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel-chromium braze alloys.()Biological roleThere is a boron-containing natural antibiotic, boromycin, isolated from streptomyces.()() Boron is an essential plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. Conversely, high soil concentrations of > 1.0 ppm can cause marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8 ppm can cause these same symptoms to appear in plants particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of boron in the soil, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when boron content in the soil is greater than 1.8 ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0 ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive. When boron levels in plant tissue exceed 200 ppm symptoms of boron toxicity are likely to appear.()()()As an element, boron is necessary for the optimal health of rats, although it is necessary in such small amounts that ultrapurified foods and dust filtration of air is necessary to induce boron deficiency, which manifest as poor coat or hair quality. Presumably, boron is necessary to other mammals. No deficiency syndrome in humans has been described. Small amounts of boron occur widely in the diet, and the amounts needed in the diet would, by analogy with rodent studies, be very small. The exact physiological role of boron in the animal kingdom is poorly understood.()Boron occurs in all foods produced from plants. Since 1989 its nutritional value has been argued. It is thought that boron plays several biochemical roles in animals, including humans.()The U.S. Department of agriculture conducted an experiment in which postmenopausal women took 3 mg of boron a day. The results showed that supplemental boron reduced excretion of calcium by 44%, and activated estrogen and D, suggesting a possible role in the suppression of osteoporosis. However, whether these effects were conventionally nutritional, or medicinal, could not be determined. The US Institutes of Health quotes this source::Total daily boron intake in normal human diets ranges from 2.14.3 mg boron/day.()()Analytical quantificationFor determination of boron content in food or materials the colorimetric curcumin method is used. Boron has to be transferred to boric acid or borates and on reaction with curcumin in acidic solution, a red colored boron-chelate complex, rosocyanine, is formed.()Boron pharmaceuticals and biologicalsBoric acid has antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties and for this reasons is applied as a water clarifier in swimming pool water treatment.() Mild solutions of boric acid have been used as eye antiseptics.A number of potential boronated pharmaceuticals using boron-10, have been prepared for use in neutron capture therapy (BNCT).(http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/boron-neutron-capture-therapy-overview Overview of neutron capture therapy pharmaceuticals.)Some boron compounds show promise in treating arthritis, though none have as yet been generally approved for the purpose.()Boron is used as an intermediate in pharmaceutical synthesis, but it appeared as an active element in its first-approved organic pharamaceutical in bortezomib, a new class of drug called proteasome inhibitors, which are active in myeloma and one form of lymphoma. The boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome() with high affinity and specificity.Health issuesElemental boron, boron oxide, acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are non-toxic to humans and animals (approximately similar to table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2 g are considered non-toxic. The minimum lethal dose for humans has not been established, but an intake of 4 g/day was reported without incidents, and medical dosages of 20 g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy caused no problems. Fish have survived for 30 min in a saturated boric acid solution and can survive longer in strong borax solutions.() Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.(The boranes and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but toxicity depends on structure.()()The boranes (boron hydrogen compounds) are toxic as well as highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard due to its reducing nature, and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.()endothelial dystrophy type 2, a rare form of corneal dystrophy, is linked to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.()See also*of boron*Boron compounds*Boron deficiency*oxide*nitride*neutron capture therapy*acid*reaction*couplingReferencesExternal links**Boron*WebElements.com  Boron*National Pollutant Inventory  Boron and compounds(element)ar:an:Boroast:Boruaz:Borbn: (element)()ca:Bor()(prvek)co:Borucy:Boron(grundstof)de:Bordv:et:Boorel:es:Boroeo:Boroeu:Borofa:hif:Boronfr:Bore(elemint)fur:Brga:Brngv:Borongl:Borohak:Phnxal:ko:haw:Boronhy:hi:(element)io:Boronoid:Boronis:Brit:Boro()jv:Boronkn:sw:Boronikv:ku:Bor()la:Boriumlv:Borslb:Borlt:Boraslij:Boroln:Bolojbo:jicmrborohu:Br( )ml:mi:Ptiwhamr:ms:Boronmy:nah:Xacoiztatl(element)ne:new:ja:frr:Boor(grunnstoff)bornov:Boreoc:Br(unsur)pa:pnb:(Element)pl:Borpt:Boro(element)qu:Boru()sa:stq:Borsq:Boriscn:Borusi:simple:Boronsk:Br(element)( )(element)fi:Boorisv:Bortl:Boronta:te:th:tg:tr:Boruk:ug:vi:Bowar:Boro()yo:Boronzh-yue:zh:

Benjamin_Disraeli
Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, KG, PC, FRS, (21 December 1804  19 April 1881) was a British Prime Minister, parliamentarian, Conservative statesman and literary figure. Starting from comparatively humble origins, he served in government for three decades, twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Although his father had him baptised to Anglicanism at age 12, he was nonetheless Britains first and thus far only Prime Minister who was born into a Jewish familyoriginally from Italy.() He played an instrumental role in the creation of the modern Conservative Party after the Laws schism of 1846.Although a major figure in the protectionist wing of the Conservative Party after 1844, Disraelis relations with the other leading figures in the party, particularly Lord Derby, the overall leader, were often strained. Not until the 1860s would Derby and Disraeli be on easy terms, and the latters succession of the former assured. From 1852 onwards, Disraelis career would also be marked by his often intense rivalry with Ewart Gladstone, who eventually rose to become leader of the Liberal Party. In this feud, Disraeli was aided by his warm friendship with Victoria, who came to detest Gladstone during the latters first premiership in the 1870s. In 1876 Disraeli was raised to the peerage as the Earl of Beaconsfield, capping nearly four decades in the House of Commons.Before and during his political career, Disraeli was well known as a literary and social figure, although his novels are not generally regarded as a part of the Victorian literary canon. He mainly wrote romances, of which Sybil and Grey are perhaps the best-known today. He is exceptional among British Prime Ministers for having gained equal social and political renown. He was twice successful as the University Conservative Associations candidate for Rector of the University, holding the post for two full terms between 1871 and 1877.Early lifeDisraelis biographers believe he was descended from Italian Sephardic Jews. He claimed Portuguese ancestry, possibly referring to an earlier origin of his family heritage in Iberia prior to the expulsion of Jews in 1492. His grandmother, Rebeca Rietti, was of Italian descent. After this event many Jews emigrated, in two waves; the bulk fled to the Muslim lands of the Ottoman Empire, but many went to Christian Europe, first to northern Italy, then to the Netherlands, and later to England.(. Norman Gash, reviewing Blakes work, argued that Benjamins claim to Spanish ancestry could not be entirely dismissed. ) One modern historian has seen him as essentially a marrano.(M. C. N. Salbstein, Benjamin Disraeli, Marrano Englishman, in The Emancipation of the Jews in Britain, 97114. (New Jersey 1982))(Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews, p.323)He was the second child and eldest son of DIsraeli, a literary critic and historian, and Maria Basevi. Benjamin changed the spelling in the 1820s by dropping the apostrophe.(Opponents, however, continued to include the apostrophe in correspondence. Lord Lincoln, writing to Sir Peel in 1846, referred to  DIsraeli. . Peel did so as well, see . Even in the 1870s, towards the end of Disraelis career, this practice continued. See .) His siblings included Sarah (18021859), Naphtali (1807), Ralph (18091898), and James (18131868).() Benjamin at first attended a small school, the Reverend John Potticarys school at Blackheath.() His father had Benjamin baptised in July 1817 following a dispute with their synagogue. The elder DIsraeli was content to remain outside organised religion. From 1817, Benjamin attended a school at Hill, in Walthamstow, under Cogan.() His younger brothers, in contrast, attended the superior College.()thumb|upright|left|Isaac DIsraeli, father of Benjamin DisraeliHis father groomed him for a career in law, and Disraeli was articled to a solicitor in 1821. In 1824, Disraeli toured Belgium and the Valley with his father and later wrote that it was while travelling on the Rhine that he decided to abandon the law: I determined when descending those magical waters that I would not be a lawyer.() On his return to England he speculated on the stock exchange on various South American mining companies. The recognition of the new South American republics on the recommendation of Canning had led to a considerable boom, encouraged by various promoters. In this connection, Disraeli became involved with the financier J. D. Powles, one such booster. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies.(; )That same year Disraelis financial activities brought him into contact with the publisher John Murray who was also involved in the South American mines. Accordingly, they attempted to bring out a newspaper, The Representative, to promote both the cause of the mines and those politicians who supported the mines, specifically George Canning. The paper was a failure, in part because the mining bubble burst in late 1825, which ruined Powles and Disraeli. Also, according to Disraelis biographer, Lord Blake, the paper was atrociously edited, and would have failed regardless. Disraelis debts incurred from this debacle would haunt him for the rest of his life.()Before he entered parliament, Disraeli was involved with several women, most notably Henrietta, Lady Sykes (the wife of Sir Francis Sykes, 3rd Bt), who served as the model for Henrietta Temple. It was Henrietta who introduced Disraeli to Lord Lyndhurst, with whom she later became romantically involved. As Lord Blake observed: The true relationship between the three cannot be determined with certainty ... there can be no doubt that the affair usage damaged Disraeli and that it made its contribution, along with many other episodes, to the understandable aura of distrust which hung around his name for so many years.()In 1839 he settled his private life by marrying Mary Anne Lewis, the rich widow of Wyndham Lewis, Disraelis erstwhile colleague at Maidstone. Mary Lewis was 12 years his senior, and their union was seen as being based on financial interests, but they came to cherish one another.()Literary careerDisraeli turned towards literature after his financial disaster, motivated in part by a desperate need for money, and brought out his first novel, Grey, in 1826. Disraelis biographers agree that Vivian Grey was a thinly veiled re-telling of the affair of The Representative, and it proved very popular on its release, although it also caused much offence within the Tory literary world when Disraelis authorship was discovered. The book, initially anonymous, was purportedly written by a man of fashion  someone who moved in high society. Disraeli, then just twenty-three, did not move in high society, and the numerous solecisms present in his otherwise brilliant and daring work made this painfully obvious. Reviewers were sharply critical on these grounds of both the author and the book. Furthermore, John Murray believed that Disraeli had caricatured him and abused his confidencean accusation denied at the time, and by the official biography, although subsequent biographers (notably Blake) have sided with Murray.()disraeli.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Young Disraeli by Sir Francis Grant, 1852After producing a of the English Constitution,(See here for a review and summary) and some political pamphlets, Disraeli followed up Vivian Grey with a series of novels, Young Duke (1831), Fleming (1832), Alroy (1833), Venetia and Temple (1837). During the same period he had also written Revolutionary Epick and three burlesques, Ixion, Infernal Marriage, and Popanilla. Of these only Henrietta Temple (based on his affair with Henrietta Sykes, wife of Sir Francis William Sykes, 3rd Bt) was a true success.(For Blakes account of Henrietta Sykes, see .)During the 1840s Disraeli wrote three political novels collectively known as the TrilogySybil, Coningsby, and Tancred.(Blake, pp. 190191.)Disraelis relationships with other male writers of his period were strained or non-existent. After the disaster of The Representative, Gibson Lockhart became a bitter enemy and the two never reconciled.() Disraelis preference for female company prevented the development of contact with those who were otherwise not alienated by his opinions, comportment or background. One contemporary who tried to bridge the gap, Makepeace Thackeray, established a tentative cordial relationship in the late 1840s only to see everything collapse when Disraeli took offence at a burlesque of him which Thackeray penned for Punch. Disraeli took revenge in Endymion (published in 1880), when he caricatured Thackeray as St. Barbe.(. This view has been accepted by most historians. See , who argues that St. Barbe was an attack on Carlyle.)Disraelis writing is generally interesting, and his books teem with striking thoughts, shrewd maxims, and brilliant phrases which stick in the memory; on the other hand, he is often artificial, extravagant, and turgid. Critic Kuhn argued that much of his fiction can be read as the memoirs he never wrote, revealing the inner life of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket  particularly with regard to his allegedly ambiguous sexuality.()ParliamentImage:Lord John Manners.jpg|upright|thumb|Lord John Manners, friend of Disraeli, and leading figure in the England movementDisraeli had been considering a political career as early as 1830, before he departed England for the Mediterranean. His first real efforts, however, did not come until 1832, during the great crisis over the Reform Bill, when he contributed to an anti-Whig pamphlet edited by Wilson Croker and published by Murray entitled England and France: or a cure for Ministerial Gallomania. The choice of a Tory publication was regarded as odd by Disraelis friends and relatives, who thought him more of a Radical. Indeed, Disraeli had objected to Murray about Croker inserting high Tory sentiment, writing that it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen. Further, at the time Gallomania was published, Disraeli was in fact electioneering in Wycombe in the Radical interest.() Disraelis politics at the time were influenced both by his rebellious streak and by his desire to make his mark. In the early 1830s the Tories and the interests they represented appeared to be a lost cause. The other great party, the Whigs, was anathema to Disraeli: Toryism is worn out & I cannot condescend to be a Whig.()Though he initially stood for election, unsuccessfully, as a Radical, Disraeli was a Tory by the time he won a seat in the House of Commons in 1837 representing the constituency of Maidstone.(Blake, p. 85.)Although a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the Chartists and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the merchants and new industrialists in the middle class, helping to found the England group in 1842 to promote the view that the landed interests should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by middle-class businessmen. During the twenty years between the Laws and the Second Reform Bill Disraeli would seek a Tory-Radical alliance, to little avail. Prior to the 1867 Reform Bill the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little tangible political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with Bright, a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to convince Bright to sacrifice principle for political gain. After one such attempt, Bright noted in his diary that Disraeli seems unable to comprehend the morality of our political course.(. The specific occasion was the 1852 Budget. Disraeli seems to have held out the possibility of Bright, Cobden, and Milner Gibson eventually joining the cabinet in exchange for the support of the Radicals.)Protectionthumb|upright|Sir Robert Peel, Bt., Prime Minister 183435, 184146Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel passed over Disraeli when putting together his government in 1841 and Disraeli, hurt, gradually became a sharp critic of Peels government, often deliberately adopting positions contrary to those of his nominal chief. (Peels reasons for refusing Disraeli a post in his cabinet are disputed. Some historians suggest Edward Stanleys well-known antipathy to Disraeli as the prime factor. Robert Blake dismisses these claims, arguing instead that Peels need to balance the various factions of the Conservative Party, and the heavy preponderance of aristocrats within the cabinet, precluded Disraelis inclusion. See , and .)  The best known of these cases was the grant in 1845 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The end of 1845 and the first months of 1846 were dominated by a battle in parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over the repeal of the Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and George Bentinck. An alliance of pro free-trade Conservatives (the Peelites), Radicals, and Whigs carried repeal, and the Conservative Party split: the Peelites moved towards the Whigs, while a new Conservative Party formed around the protectionists, led by Disraeli, Bentinck, and Lord Stanley (later Lord Derby).(For the bitterness over the Corn Laws, see . For the effect of the split, see .)  The context of the fight over free trade was famine in Ireland, which Peel hoped might be remedied by importation of grain.The term corn did not refer to maise as it does in the United States.  In Britain in the mid-nineteenth century, corn meant grain like wheat, oats or rye.  Predominately, however, the term referred to wheat.  Wheat was used in making bread.  Because nearly every family made bread for their own consumption, wheat was the main staple of the average diet in Britain.  Consequently, wheat was regareded as the staff of life.  Accordingly, the price of wheat had a profound effect on the cost of living of the ordinary family. Repeal of the Corn Laws would remove the tariffs on imported wheat and reduce the price of wheat and bread for the average and poor citizens of the Britain.  Immediately, Peel hoped that the repeal of the tariff on wheat (the Corn Laws) and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain, would remedy the suffering in Ireland caused by the Famine in Ireland caused by the successive failure of potato crops in Ireland due to the potato blight.   The split in the Tory/Conservative party over the repeal of the Corn Laws had profound implications for Disraelis political career: almost every Conservative politician with official experience followed Peel, leaving the rump bereft of leadership. As one biographer wrote, Disraeli found himself almost the only figure on his side capable of putting up the oratorical display essential for a parliamentary leader.() Looking on from the House of Lords, the Duke of Argyll wrote that Disraeli was like a subaltern in a great battle where every superior officer was killed or wounded.(Quoted in ) If the remainder of the Conservative Party could muster the electoral support necessary to form a government, then Disraeli was now guaranteed high office. However, he would take office with a group of men who possessed little or no official experience, who had rarely felt moved to speak in the House of Commons before, and who, as a group, remained hostile to Disraeli on a personal level, his assault on the Corn Laws notwithstanding.()Bentinck and the leadershipIn 1847 a small political crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from the leadership and highlighted Disraelis differences with his own party. In the preceding general election, de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. Ever since Catholic Emancipation, members of parliament were required to swear the oath on the true faith of a Christian. Rothschild, an unconverted Jew, could not do so and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild a member for the City of London, introduced a Disabilities Bill to amend the oath and permit Jews to enter Parliament.()left|upright|thumb|Lord George Bentinck, Conservative leader in the commons 184648Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was completed Judaism, and asking of the House of Commons Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?(Hansard, 3rd Series, xcv, 13211330, 16 December 1847.) While Disraeli did not argue that the Jews did the Christians a favour by killing Christ, as he had in Tancred and would in Lord George Bentinck,() his speech was badly received by his own party,(On the other hand, both Russell and Gladstone thought it was brave for Disraeli to speak as he did. Morley, 715716.) which along with the Anglican establishment was hostile to the bill.(Of the 26 Anglican bishops and archbishops who sat in the House of Lords, 23 voted on the measure altogether, and 17 were opposed.) Wilberforce, of Oxford and a friend of Disraelis, spoke strongly against the measure and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for helping elect him.(Hansard, 3rd Series, xcviii, 13741378, 25 May 1848.) Every member of the future protectionist cabinet then in parliament (except Disraeli) voted against the measure. One member who was not, Lord John Manners, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. Bentinck, then still Conservative leader in the Commons, joined Disraeli in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration.()In the aftermath of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and feuded with Stanley, leader in the Lords and overall leader, who had opposed the measure and directed the party whipsin the Commonsto oppose the measure as well. Bentinck was succeeded by Lord Granby; Disraelis own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being.() Even as these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase Manor, in Buckinghamshire. This purchase allowed him to stand for the county, which was essential if one was to lead the Conservative Party at the time. He and Mary Anne alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the remainder of their marriage. These negotiations were complicated by the sudden death of Lord George on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of 25,000 (equivalent to about  as of ) from Lord Georges brothers Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield.()Within a month Granby resigned the leadership in the commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without an actual leader in the commons for the remainder of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and Charles Herriesindicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted the man. This confused arrangement ended with Granbys resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.()OfficeFirst Derby governmentthumb|upright|The Earl of Derby, Prime Minister 1852, 185859, 186668The first opportunity for the protectionist Tories under Disraeli and Stanley to take office came in 1851, when Lord John Russells government was defeated in the House of Commons over the Titles Act 1851. Disraeli was to have been Home Secretary, with Stanley (becoming the Earl of Derby later that year) as Prime Minister. Other possible ministers included Sir Robert Inglis, Goulburn, Charles Herries, and Lord Ellenborough. The Peelites, however, refused to serve under Stanley or with Disraeli so long as the question of trade remained unsettled, and attempts to form a purely protectionist government failed. Derby supposedly remarked at the time, Pshaw! These are not names which I can put before the Queen!()Russell resumed office, but resigned again in early 1852 when a combination of the protectionists and Lord Palmerston defeated him on a Militia Bill.(Palmerston got his tit for tat with Johnny Russell, who under pressure from the Crown had dismissed Palmerston from the Foreign Office the previous December.) This time Lord Derby (as he had become) took office, and to general surprise appointed Disraeli of the Exchequer.(The expectation had been that Disraeli would assume the Foreign or Home offices.) Disraeli had offered to stand aside as leader in the House of Commons in favour of Palmerston, but the latter declined.(Blake, p. 311.)The primary responsibility of a mid-Victorian chancellor was to produce a Budget for the coming fiscal year. Disraeli proposed to reduce taxes on malt(Karl Marx, Parliament--Vote of November 26--Disraelis Budget contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11 (International Publishers: New York, 1979) p. 461) and tea(Karl Marx, Parliament--Vote of November 26--Disraelis Budget contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11 p. 461.) (taxation); additional revenue would come from an increase in the tax.(Karl Marx, Parliament--Vote of November 26--Disraelis Budget contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11, p. 462.)  More controversially, Disraeli also proposed to alter the workings of the tax (taxation) by differentiatingi.e., different rates would be levied on different types of income.(; .) As noted above, Disraeli had been opposed to the repeal of the corn laws in June of 1846.  Repeal of the Corn Laws had removed the tariffs on the importation of cheap corn/wheat into Britain.  Thus the price of wheat had fallen.  Farmers now received less income from the sale of their wheat.  However, the aristocratic landlords did not adjust the rent they were charging the for the land they rented to the farmers for growing the wheat or corn.  Thus the farmers were placed in a disadvantageous economic position.  Disraeli sought to alleviate this disadvantage by differentially raising income tax rates against non-farmers and lowering income taxes for the farmers.(Karl Marx, Political Consequences of the Commerical Excitement contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11, p. 364.)   This, Disaeli felt, would allow the landed aristocracy to continue collecting the same rent and would compensate the farmers for their lost income.(Karl Marx, Parliament--Vote of November 26--Disraelis Budget contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels Volume 11, p. 458 and Karl Marx, Political Consequences of the Commercial Excitement contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11, p. 364.)  The budget as viewed by many Whigs as compensation to the landlords; and viewed by some as a compensation with a revenge against those who had obtained repeal of the Corn Laws.(Karl Marx, Parliament--Vote of November 26--Disraelis Budget contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11 p. 463.)   The establishment of the income tax on a permanent basis had been the subject of much inter-party discussion since the, fall of Peels ministry in June of 1846.  Since that time, no consensus had been yet been reached, and Disraeli was criticised for mixing up details over the different schedules of income. Disraelis proposal to extend the tax to Ireland gained him further enemies, and he was also hampered by an unexpected increase in defence expenditure, which was forced on him by Derby and Sir John Pakington (of State for War and the Colonies) (leading to his celebrated remark to Bright about the damned defences).(Brights diary quotes the conversation in full. See ) This, combined with bad timing and perceived inexperience led to the failure of the Budget and consequently the fall of the government on 17 December 1852.(On the centrality of the income tax, see .)(Karl Marx, Britiish Politics contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12 (International Publishers: New York, 1979) p. 3.)Gladstones final speech on the failed Budget marked the beginning of over twenty years of mutual parliamentary hostility, as well as the end of Gladstones formal association with the Conservative Party. Disraeli even favoured certain concessions to the traders in order to broaden the support for the Conservative Party. This position brought him unpopularity with the protectionists of his own party.(Note 2 contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12 p. 636.)  Because of the split in the Conservative Party and because of Disraelis unpopularity, arising from the budget fight of 1852, which is outlined above, no Conservative reconciliation remained possible so long as Disraeli remained leader in the House of Commons.(Blake, pp. 346347.)  As a result, Disraeli was replaced as leader of the minority Conservative Party by Lord Pakington in March 1853.(Karl Marx, British Politics contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 12, p. 3.)OppositionWith the fall of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches. Derbys successor as Prime Minister was the Peelite Lord Aberdeen, whose ministry was composed of both Peelites and Whigs. Disraeli himself was succeeded as chancellor by Gladstone.(Blake, p. 350.)Second Derby governmentthumb|upright|The Viscount Palmerston, Prime Minister 185558, 185965Lord Palmerstons government collapsed in 1858 amid public fallout over the Orsini affair and Derby took office at the head of a purely Conservative administration. He again offered a place to Gladstone, who declined. Disraeli remained leader of the House of Commons and returned to the Exchequer. As in 1852 Derbys was a government, dependent on the division of its opponents for survival.() The principal measure of the 1858 session would be a bill to re-organise governance of India, the Indian Mutiny having exposed the inadequacy of dual control. The first attempt at legislation was drafted by the of the Board of Control, Lord Ellenborough, who had previously served as of India (184144). The bill, however, was riddled with complexities and had to be withdrawn. Soon after, Ellenborough was forced to resign over an entirely separate matter involving the current Governor-General, Lord Canning.()Faced with a vacancy, Disraeli and Derby tried yet again to bring Gladstone into the government. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, asking him to place the good of the party above personal animosity: Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that disposes of all this... In responding to Disraeli Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decision then and previously to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby broader than you may have supposed. Gladstone also hinted at the strength of his own faith, and the role it played in his public life, when he addressed Disraelis most personal and private appeal:I state these points fearlessly and without reserve, for you have yourself well reminded me that there is a Power beyond us that disposes of what we are and do, and I find the limits of choice in public life to be very narrow.W. E. Gladstone to Disraeli, 1858()With Gladstones refusal Derby and Disraeli looked elsewhere and settled on Disraelis old friend Bulwer-Lytton, who became of State for the Colonies; Derbys son Lord Stanley, succeeded Ellenborough at the Board of Control. Stanley, with Disraelis assistance, proposed and guided through the house the India Act, under which the subcontinent would be governed for sixty years. The East India Company and its Governor-General were replaced by a viceroy and the Indian Council, while at Westminster the Board of Control was abolished and its functions assumed by the newly created India Office, under the of State for India.()The 1867 Reform Billupright|thumb|William Ewart GladstoneFour-time Prime MinisterAfter engineering the defeat of a Liberal Reform Bill introduced by Gladstone in 1866,(Blake, pp. 442444.) Disraeli and Derby introduced their own measure in 1867.(Blake, pp. 456457.) This was primarily a political strategy designed to give the Conservative party control of the reform process and the subsequent long-term benefits in the Commons, similar to those derived by the Whigs after their 1832 Reform Act. It was thought that if the Conservatives were able to secure this piece of legislation, then the newly enfranchised electorate may return their gratitude to the Tories in the form of a Conservative vote at the next general election. As a result, this would give the Conservatives a greater chance of forming a majority government. After so many years in the stagnant backwaters of British politics, this seemed most appealing. The Act 1867 extended the franchise by 938,427  an increase of 88%  by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least 10 pounds for rooms and eliminating boroughs with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granting constituencies to fifteen unrepresented towns, and extra representation in parliament to larger towns such as Liverpool and Manchester, which had previously been under-represented in Parliament.() This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably Lord Cranborne (later the Marquess of Salisbury), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals.(Quoted in ) Cranborne, however, was unable to lead a rebellion similar to that which Disraeli had led against Peel twenty years earlier.(Blake, p. 461..)Prime ministerFirst governmentImage:3rd Marquess of Salisbury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-time Prime Minister Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of SalisburyDerbys health had been declining for some time and he finally resigned as Prime Minister in late February 1868; he would live for twenty months. Disraelis efforts over the past two years had dispelled, for the time being, any doubts about him succeeding Derby as leader of the Conservative Party and therefore Prime Minister. As Disraeli remarked, I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole.()However, the Conservatives were still a minority in the House of Commons, and the passage of the Reform Bill required the calling of new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraelis term as Prime Minister would therefore be fairly short, unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced Lord Chelmsford as Chancellor with Lord Cairns, and brought in Ward Hunt as of the Exchequer. Disraeli and Chelmsford had never got along particularly well, and Cairns, in Disraelis view, was a far stronger minister.()Disraelis first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the established of Ireland. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with Cardinal Manning the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in Dublin foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal divided the Conservative Party while reuniting the Liberals under Gladstones leadership. While Disraelis government survived until the December general election, the initiative had passed to the Liberals, who were returned to power with a majority of 170.()Second governmentAfter six years in opposition, Disraeli and the Conservative Party won the election of 1874, giving the party its first absolute majority in the House of Commons since the 1840s. Under the stewardship of R. A. Cross, the Secretary, Disraelis government introduced various reforms, including the and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, the Health Act 1875, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876). His government also introduced a new Act meant to protect workers, the and Protection of Property Act 1875 to allow peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the Liberal-Labour MP Alexander Macdonald told his constituents in 1879, The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty.()ImperialismImage:old disraeli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Disraeli and Victoria, during the latters visit to Manor at the height of the Eastern crisis.Image:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright|New Crowns for Old depicts Disraeli as Abanazer from the pantomime version of Aladdin offering Victoria an imperial crown in exchange for a royal one.Disraeli cultivated a public image of himself as an Imperialist with grand gestures such as conferring on Queen Victoria the title Empress of India.Disraeli was, according to some interpretations, a supporter of the expansion and preservation of the Empire in the Middle East and Central Asia. In spite of the objections of his own cabinet and without Parliaments consent, he obtained a short-term loan from de Rothschild in order to purchase 44% of the shares of the Canal Company. Before this action, though, he had for the most part opted to continue the Whig policy of limited expansion, preferring to maintain the then-current borders as opposed to promoting expansion.(For the Suez deal, see .)Disraeli and Gladstone clashed over Britains Balkan policy. Disraeli saw the situation as a matter of British imperial and strategic interests, keeping to Palmerstons policy of supporting the Ottoman Empire against Russian expansion. According to Blake, Disraeli believed in upholding Britains greatness through a tough, no nonsense foreign policy that put Britains interests above the moral law that advocated emancipation of small nations.() Gladstone, however, saw the issue in moral terms, for Bulgarian Christians had been massacred by the Turks and Gladstone therefore believed it was immoral to support the Ottoman Empire. Blake further argued that Disraelis imperialism decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else.(A leading proponent of Great Game, Disraeli introduced the Titles Act 1876, which created Queen Victoria of India, putting her at the same level as the Russian Tsar. In his private correspondence with the Queen, he proposed to clear Central Asia of Muscovites and drive them into the Caspian.(Quoted from Disraelis letter to the Queen in Mahajan, 53.) In order to contain Russias influence, he launched an invasion of Afghanistan and signed the Convention with Turkey, whereby this strategically placed island was handed over to Britain.Disraeli scored another diplomatic success at the of Berlin in 1878, in preventing Bulgaria from gaining full independence, limiting the growing influence of Russia in the Balkans and breaking up the of the Three Emperors.() However, difficulties in South Africa (epitomised by the defeat of the British Army at the of Isandlwana), as well as Afghanistan, weakened his government and led to his partys defeat in the 1880 election.()Title and deathDisraeli was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876 when Victoria made him Earl of Beaconsfield and Viscount Hughenden.()Image:Disraelideathmask.jpg|thumb|upright|left|caption|Disraelis maskIn the general election of 1880 Disraelis Conservatives were defeated by Gladstones Liberals, in large part owing to the uneven course of the Anglo-Afghan War. The Irish Home Rule vote in England contributed to his partys defeat. Disraeli became ill soon after and died in April 1881.()He is buried in a vault beneath St Michaels Church in the grounds of his home Manor, accessed from the churchyard. Against the outside wall of the church is a memorial erected in his honour by Queen Victoria. His executor, and for all intents and purposes his heir, was his private secretary, Lord Rowton.() The Disraeli vault also contains the body of Sarah Brydges Willyams, the wife of James Brydges Willyams of Mawgan in Cornwall. Her wish to be buried there was granted after she left an estate sworn at under 40,000, of which Disraeli received over 30,000.Disraeli has a memorial in Westminster Abbey. He is also remembered with a large statue in the market town of Ormskirk where he graces the centre of famous student town.JudaismAlthough born of Jewish parents, Disraeli was baptised in the Christian faith at the age of twelve, and remained an observant Anglican for the rest of his life.(. See also .) Adam Kirsch, in his biography of Disraeli, states that his Jewishness was both the greatest obstacle to his ambition and its greatest engine.() Much of the criticism of his policies was couched in anti-Semitic terms. He was depicted in some antisemitic political cartoons with a big nose and curly black hair, called Shylock and abominable Jew, and portrayed in the act of ritually murdering the infant Britannia.( In response to an anti-Semitic comment made by OConnell in the British parliament, Disraeli memorably defended his Jewishness with the statement, Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the Right Honourable Gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the of Solomon.()() One apocryphal story states that Disraeli reconverted to Judaism on his deathbed.(Ragussis, M.

Biostatistics
Biostatistics (a contraction of biology and statistics; sometimes referred to as biometry or biometrics) is the application of statistics to a wide range of topics in biology. The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological experiments, especially in medicine and agriculture; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. Biostatistics and the history of biological thought Biostatistical reasoning and modeling were of critical importance to the foundation theories of modern biology. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of Mendels work, the conceptual gaps in understanding between genetics and evolutionary Darwinism led to vigorous debate between biometricians such as Walter Weldon and Pearson and Mendelians such as Charles Davenport, Bateson and Johannsen. By the 1930s statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian evolutionary synthesis. The leading figures in the establishment of this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology.* Sir Ronald A. Fisher developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work Genetical Theory of Natural Selection* G. Wright used statistics in the development of modern genetics* J. B. S Haldanes book, The Causes of Evolution, reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics.These individuals and the work of other biostatisticians, mathematical biologists, and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together biology and genetics into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be quantitatively modeled.In parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of Thompson in On Growth and Form also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.Despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not qualitatively apparent. One anecdote describes Hunt Morgan banning the Friden calculator from his department at Caltech, saying Well, I am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the Sacramento River in 1849. With a little intelligence, I can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. And as long as I can do that, Im not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in mining.() Educators are now adjusting their curricula to focus on more quantitative concepts and tools.() Education and training programs Almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at postgraduate level. They are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture or as a focus of application in departments of statistics. In the States, while several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as epidemiology. Thus departments carrying the name biostatistics may exist under quite different structures. For instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on bioinformatics and biology, whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of health, will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and trials as well as bioinformatics. In larger universities where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. In general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics one is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry (control), business and economics and biological areas other than medicine. Applications of biostatistics* health, including epidemiology, services research, nutrition, and health* Design and analysis of trials in medicine* genetics, and genetics in order to link variation in genotype with a variation in phenotype.

Bigfoot
File:Smalfut.jpg|thumb|350px|Frame 352 from the film, alleged by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin to show a bigfoot, and by some others to show a man in an suit.()Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, is an ape-like cryptid that purportedly inhabits forests, mainly in the Northwest region of America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. The term sasquatch is an anglicized derivative of the word ssquac which means wild man in a Salish Native American language.() Scientists discount the existence of bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax,() rather than a living animal, in part because of the large numbers thought necessary to maintain a breeding population.(() A few scientists, such as Goodall() and Meldrum, have expressed interest and belief in the creature, with Meldrum expressing the opinion that evidence collected of alleged Bigfoot encounters warrants further evaluation and testing.() Bigfoot remains one of the more famous examples of a cryptid within cryptozoology, and an enduring legend.DescriptionBigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy ape-like creature, ranging between  tall, weighing in excess of , and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair.()() Alleged witnesses have described large eyes, a pronounced brow ridge, and a large, low-set forehead; the top of the head has been described as rounded and crested, similar to the crest of the male gorilla. Bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it.() The enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as  long and  wide.( While most casts have five toeslike all known apessome casts of alleged bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six.() Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws.((Bear signs, San Diego Natural History Museum.) Some proponents have also claimed that bigfoot is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal.()HistoryBefore 1958Wildmen stories are found among the indigenous population of the Pacific Northwest. The legends existed prior to a single name for the creature.(Daegling 2004, p. 28) They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar stories of wildmen are found on every continent except Antarctica.( Ecologist Michael Pyle argues that most cultures have human-like giants in their folk history: We have this need for some larger-than-life creature.()Members of the Lummi tell tales about Tsemekwes, the local version of bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in terms of the general descriptions of Tsemekwes, but details about the creatures diet and activities differed between the stories of different families.()Some regional versions contained more nefarious creatures. The stiyaha or kwi-kwiyai were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a personsometimes to be killed.() In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the native people about skoocooms: a race of cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of St. Helens.( The skoocooms appear to have been regarded as supernatural, rather than natural.(Less menacing versions such as the one recorded by Reverend Elkanah Walker exist. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living in Washington. The Indians claimed that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole salmon from the fishermens nets.()The local legends were combined together by J. W. Burns in a series of Canadian newspaper articles in the 1920s. Each language had its own name for the local version.(See  for a list of names.) Many names meant something along the lines of wild man or hairy man although other names described common actions it was said to perform (e.g. eating clams).( Burns coined the term Sasquatch, which is from the Halkomelem ssqets (),(Bright, William (2004). Native American Place Names of the United States. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 422) and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature reflected in these various stories.(()() Burnss articles popularized both the legend and its new name, making it well known in western Canada before it gained popularity in the United States.()After 1958In 1951, Eric Shipton had photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint.( This photograph generated considerable attention and the story of the Yeti entered into popular consciousness. The notoriety of ape-men grew over the decade, culminating in 1958 when large footprints were found in Norte County, California, by bulldozer operator Gerald Crew. Sets of large tracks appeared multiple times around a road-construction site in Bluff Creek. After not being taken seriously about what he was seeing, Crew brought in his friend, Bob Titmus, to cast the prints in plaster. The story was published in the Humboldt Times along with a photo of Crew holding one of the casts.( Locals had been calling the unseen track-maker Big Foot since the late summer, which Humboldt Times columnist Andrew Genzoli shortened to Bigfoot in his article.(Buhs, Joshua Blu, Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, 2009), 69, 75) Bigfoot gained international attention when the story was picked up by the Press.(() Following the death of Ray Wallace  a local logger  his family attributed the creation of the footprints to him.( The wife of Scoop Beal, the editor of the Humboldt Standard, which later combined with the Humboldt Times, in which Genzolis story had appeared,(Buhs, Joshua Blu, Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend (Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, 2009), 241) has stated that her husband was in on the hoax with Wallace.()1958 was a watershed year for not just the bigfoot story itself but also the culture that surrounds it. The first bigfoot hunters began following the discovery of footprints at Bluff Creek, California. Within a year, Tom Slick, who had funded searches for Yeti in the Himalayas earlier in the decade, organized searches for bigfoot in the area around Bluff Creek.(Daegling 2004, p. 35)As Bigfoot has become better known and a phenomenon in popular culture, sightings have spread throughout North America. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes region and the United States have had many reports of Bigfoot sightings.()Prominent reported sightingsAbout a third of all reports of Bigfoot sightings are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, with most of the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America.(()() Some Bigfoot advocates, such as cryptozoologist Willison Green, have postulated that Bigfoot is a worldwide phenomenon.() The most notable reports include:*1924: Fred Beck claimed that he and four other miners were attacked one night in July 1924, by several apemen throwing rocks at their cabin in an area later called Canyon, Washington.() Beck said the miners shot and possibly killed at least one of the creatures, precipitating an attack on their cabin, during which the creatures bombarded the cabin with rocks and tried to break in. The supposed incident was widely reported at the time.(Gorilla Seeahtik Indians and prospectors, Engineering and Mining Journal-Press, 16 Aug. 1924, p.242.) Beck wrote a book about the alleged event in 1967, in which he argued that the creatures were mystical beings from another dimension, claiming that he had experienced psychic premonitions and visions his entire life of which the apemen were only one component.(Beck, Fred; told to Ronald A. Beck. (1967) I Fought The Apemen of Mount St. Helens, WA.) Speleologist William Halliday argued in 1983 that the story arose from an incident in which hikers from a nearby camp had thrown rocks into the canyon.() There are also local rumors that pranksters harassed the men and planted faked footprints.(*1941: Jeannie Chapman and her children said they had escaped their home when a  tall Sasquatch approached their residence in Creek, British Columbia.()*1958: Bulldozer operator Jerry Crew took to a newspaper office a cast of one of the enormous footprints he and other workers had seen at an isolated work site at Bluff Creek, California. The crew was overseen by Wilbur L. Wallace, brother of L. Wallace. After Ray Wallaces death, his children came forward with a pair of  wooden feet, which they said their father had used to fake the Bigfoot tracks in 1958.(() Wallace is poorly regarded by many Bigfoot proponents. John Napier wrote, I do not feel impressed with Mr. Wallaces story regarding having over  of film showing Bigfoot.(Napier 1973, p. 89)*1967: Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin reported that on October 20 they had captured a purported Sasquatch on film at Bluff Creek, California. This came to be known as the film. Many years later, Bob Heironimus, an acquaintance of Pattersons, said that he had worn an ape costume for the making of the film.(*2007: On September 16, 2007, hunter Rick Jacobs captured an image of a supposed Sasquatch by using an automatically triggered camera attached to a tree,() prompting a spokesperson for the Game Commission to say that it was likely an image of a bear with a severe case of mange.()  The photo was taken near the town of Pennsylvania, in the National Forest.(()Proposed explanations for sightingsVarious types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature Bigfoot would be if it existed. The scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks. While cryptozoologists generally explain Bigfoot as an unknown ape, some believers in Bigfoot attribute the phenomenon to UFOs or other paranormal causes.() A minority of proponents of a natural explanation have attributed Bigfoot to animals that are not apes such as the giant ground sloth.(Daegling 2004, p. 20)MisidentificationIn 2007, the Game Commission said that photos the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization claimed showed a juvenile Bigfoot were most likely of a bear with mange.()() Meldrum, on the other hand, said the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bear-like, and stated that he felt they were more like a human.() Hoaxes Both scientists and Bigfoot believers agree that many of the sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals. Cryptozoologists Coleman and Diane Stocking have estimated that as many as 70 to 80 percent of sightings are not real.(Bigfoot sightings or footprints are often demonstrably hoaxes. Author Jerome Clark argues that the Jacko affair, involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia, was a hoax. Citing research by John Green, who found that several contemporary British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as very dubious, Clark notes that the Mainland Guardian of Westminster, British Columbia, wrote, Absurdity is written on the face of it.()On July 14, 2005, Biscardi, a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., appeared on the to Coast AM paranormal radio show and announced that he was 98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they have been tracking in the Camp, California area.() A month later, Biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a pay-per-view event for people to see it. Biscardi appeared on Coast to Coast AM again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. Biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him, and the shows audience for being gullible.(On July 9, 2008, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton posted a video to YouTube claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern Georgia. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate.  Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc., as a faith gesture.() The story of the mens claims was covered by many major news networks, including BBC,() CNN,() News,() and News.() Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body arrived in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team. When the contents were thawed, it was discovered that the hair was not real, the head was hollow, and the feet were rubber.()() Dyer and Whitton subsequently admitted it was a hoax after being confronted by Steve Kulls, executive director of Squatchdetective.com.()GigantopithecusBigfoot proponents Krantz and Geoffrey Bourne believe that Bigfoot could be a relict population of Gigantopithecus. Bourne contends that as most Gigantopithecus fossils are found in China, and as many species of animals migrated across the Bering land bridge, it is not unreasonable to assume that Gigantopithecus might have as well.()The Gigantopithecus hypothesis is generally considered entirely speculative. Gigantopithecus fossils are not found in the Americas.  As the only recovered fossils are of mandibles and teeth, there is some uncertainty about Gigantopithecuss locomotion. Krantz has argued, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible, that blacki could have been bipedal.  However, the relevant part of mandible is not present in any fossils.(Daegling 2004, p. 14) The mainstream view is that Gigantopithecus was quadrupedal, and it has been argued that Gigantopithecuss enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.Matt Cartmill presents another problem with the Gigantopithecus hypothesis: The trouble with this account is that Gigantopithecus was not a hominin and maybe not even a crown-group hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.(Cartmill 2008, p. 117)Bernard G. Campbellin wrote: That Gigantopithecus is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing.()Extinct hominidae A species of Paranthropus, such as robustus, with its crested skull and bipedal gait, was suggested by primatologist John Napier and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg as a possible candidate for Bigfoots identity,() despite the fact that fossils of Paranthropus are found only in Africa.Michael Rugg, of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, presented a comparison between human, Gigantopithecus and Meganthropus skulls (reconstructions made by Krantz) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show.() He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a bigfoot to the Meganthropus fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the occlusal surface.  The Meganthropus fossils originated from Asia, the tooth was found in the Pacific Northwest.Some suggest Neanderthal, erectus, or heidelbergensis to be the creature, but no remains of any of those species have been found in the Americas.(Daegling 2004, p. 16)Scientific viewquoted2The scientific community discounts the existence of Bigfoot, as there is no evidence supporting the survival of such a large, prehistoric ape-like creature. The evidence that does exist points more towards a hoax or delusion than to sightings of a genuine creature.( In a 1996 Today article titled Bigfoot Merely Amuses Most Scientists, Washington State zoologist John Crane says, There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material thats clearly been fabricated has ever been presented.() In addition to the lack of evidence, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized nonhuman apes are found in the tropics of Africa and Asia.  Thus, as with other proposed megafauna cryptids, climate and food supply issues would make such a creatures survival in reported habitats unlikely.() Furthermore, great apes are not found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains have ever been found. Indeed, scientific consensus is that the breeding population of such an animal would be so large that it would account for many more purported sightings than currently occur, making the existence of such an animal an almost certain impossibility.(A few scientists have been less skeptical about the claims of the existence of sasquatch. Meldrum characterizes the search for Sasquatch as a valid scientific endeavor. and says that the fossil remains of an ancient giant ape called Gigantopithecus could turn out to be ancestors of todays commonly known Bigfoot.() John Napier asserts that the scientific communitys attitude towards Bigfoot stems primarily from insufficient evidence.() Other scientists who have shown varying degrees of interest in the legend are anthropologist David Daegling,(Daegling 2004) field biologist Shaller,(()(Napier 1973, p. 197) Mittermeier, Swindler, Sarmiento,() and discredited racial anthropologist S. Coon.()  Goodall, in a September 27, 2002 interview on National Public Radios Science Friday, expressed her ideas about the existence of Bigfoot. First stating Im sure they exist, she later went on to say, chuckling, Well, Im a romantic, so I always wanted them to exist, and finally: You know, why isnt there a body? I cant answer that, and maybe they dont exist, but I want them to.()  However, the vast majority of evolutionary biologists, anthropologists and paleontologists completely dismiss the possibility of the existence of sasquatch.Bigfoot organizationsThere are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot sightings in the United States. The oldest and largest is the Bigfoot Field Research Organization or BFRO. The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their internet website includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility.() See also * Canyon* in popular culture* trap* of cryptids* Day footage* cast* and the Hendersons Footnotes Further reading * * * * * * External links *Bigfoot at 50 Evaluating a Half-Century of Bigfoot Evidencegranscs:Bigfootcy:Troedfawrda:Bigfootde:BigfootGrandeeo:Saskvaofa:fr:Sasquatchko:hr:Bigfootid:BigfootFoothe:hu:Nagylbnl:Bigfootja:no:BigfootStopa (zwierz)pt:P-granderu:sco:Bigfitsimple:Bigfootsr:fi:Isojalkasv:Bigfoottl:Bigfootth:tr:Sasquatchzh:

Bing_Crosby
 website              http://www.bingcrosby.comHarry Lillis Bing Crosby (May 3, 1903  October 14, 1977)(Obituary Variety, October 19, 1977.) was an American singer and actor. Crosbys trademark bass-baritone voice made him one of the best-selling recording artists of the 20th century, with over half a billion records in circulation.()A multimedia star, from 1934 to 1954 Bing Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses.(Giddins, 2001, p. 8.) His early career coincided with technical recording innovations; this allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced many of the popular male singers who followed him, including Como,(, cassette 1, side B.) Sinatra, and Martin. Yank magazine recognized Crosby as the person who had done the most for American G.I. morale during World War II and, during his peak years, around 1948, polls declared him the most admired man alive, ahead of Robinson and Pius XII.(Giddins, 2001, p. 6.)() Also in 1948, the Music Digest estimated that Crosby recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.(Crosby exerted an important influence on the development of the postwar recording industry. He worked for NBC at the time and wanted to record his shows; however, most networks did not allow recording. This was mainly because of the quality of recording at the time. While in Europe performing during the war, Crosby had witnessed tape recording, on which The Crosby Research Foundation would come to have many patents. The company also developed equipment and recording techniques such as the Track which are still in use today.(Sterling, C. H., & Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay tuned: A concise history of American broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.) In 1947, he invested $50,000 in the Ampex company, which built North Americas first commercial tape recorder. He left NBC to work for ABC, because NBC was not interested in recording at the time. This proved beneficial because ABC accepted him and his new ideas.(Sterling, C. H., & Kittross, J. M. (1990). Stay tuned: A concise history of american broadcasting (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.) Crosby then became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto tape. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician Paul, which led directly to Pauls invention of recording. Along with Sinatra, Crosby was one of the principal backers behind the famous Western Recorders studio complex in Los Angeles.(Cogan, Jim; Clark, William, Temples of sound : inside the great recording studios, San Francisco : Chronicle Books, 2003. ISBN 0811833941)During the Golden Age of Radio, performers often had to recreate their live shows a second time for the west coast time zone.  Through the aegis of recording, Crosby constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, shifting) being used in motion picture production.  This became the industry standard.Crosby won an Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck OMalley in the 1944 motion picture My Way, and was nominated for his reprise of the role in Bells of St. Marys the next year, becoming the first of four actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award.() Crosby is one of the 22 people to have three stars on the Walk of Fame.Early lifeCrosby was born in Washington, on May 3, 1903,( in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street.(Bing Crosby had no birth certificate and his birth date was unconfirmed until his childhood Roman Catholic church released his baptismal record.) In 1906, Crosbys family moved to Washington.(accessdate2011-01-04) In 1913, Crosbys father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Ave.() The house now sits on the campus of Bings alma mater University and formerly housed the Alumni Association.He was the fourth of seven children: brothers Larry (18951975), Everett (18961966), Ted (19001973), Harry Bing (19031977), and Bob (19131993); and two girls, Catherine (19041974) and Mary Rose (19061990). His parents, Harry Lincoln Crosby (18701950), an English-American bookkeeper, and Catherine Helen (known as Kate) Harrigan (18731964), who was a second generation Irish-American.()  Bings paternal ancestors had emigrated to what would become the U.S. in the 17th century, and included Patience Brewster, the daughter of the Pilgrim leader and Mayflower passenger William Brewster, (c. 1567  April 10, 1644).(Giddins, 2001, p. 24.)In 1910, six-year-old Harry Crosby was forever renamed. The Sunday edition of the Spokesman-Review published a feature called The Bingville Bugle.()()  Written by humorist Newkirk, The Bingville Bugle was a parody of a hillbilly newsletter filled with gossipy tidbits, minstrel quips, creative spelling, and mock ads. A neighbor, 15-year-old Valentine Hobart, shared Crosbys enthusiasm for The Bugle and noting Crosbys laugh, took a liking to him and called him Bingo from Bingville. Eventually the last vowel was dropped and the nickname stuck.()In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at Spokanes Auditorium, where he witnessed some of the finest acts of the day, including Jolson, who held Crosby spellbound with his libbing and spoofs of Hawaiian songs.  Crosby later described Jolsons delivery as electric.(, cassette 3, side B.)Popular successMusicBy 1925, Crosby had formed a vocal duo with partner Rinker, brother of singer Bailey. Mildred introduced Al and Bing to Whiteman, who was at that time Americas most famous bandleader. Hired for $150 a week, they made their debut on December 6, 1926 at the Theatre (Chicago). Their first recording was Ive Got The Girl, with Don Clarks Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Bing Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.Even as the Crosby and Rinker duo was increasing in popularity, Whiteman added a third member to the group.  The threesome, now including pianist and aspiring songwriter Barris, were dubbed Rhythm Boys.  They joined the Whiteman touring act, performing and recording with musicians Beiderbecke, Teagarden, Dorsey, Dorsey, and Lang and Carmichael, and appeared together in a Whiteman movie.  Crosby soon became the star attraction of Rhythm Boys, and in 1928 had his first number one hit with the Whiteman orchestra, a jazz-influenced rendition of Man River. However, Crosbys reported taste for alcohol and his growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to Rhythm Boys quitting to join the Arnheim Orchestra. During his time with Arnheim, the other two Rhythm Boys were increasingly pushed to the background as the emphasis was on Crosby. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosbys subsequent hits including At Your Command, Surrender Dear, and Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams.  But the members of the band had a falling out and split, setting the stage for Crosbys solo career.()On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his solo radio debut.() Before the end of the year, he signed with both Records and Radio.  Doing a weekly 15-minute radio broadcast, Crosby quickly became a huge hit.(  His songs Out of Nowhere, One More Chance, Your Command and Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store) were all among the best selling songs of 1931.(As the 1930s unfolded, Crosby became the leading singer in America. Ten of the top 50 songs for 1931 featured Crosby, either solo or with others. A so-called Battle of the Baritones with singing star Columbo proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan Bing Was King.  Crosby played the lead in a series of sound era musical comedy short films for Sennett, signed a long-term deal with Kapps new record company Decca, and starred in his first full-length feature, 1932s Big Broadcast, the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures.Around this time Crosby co-starred on radio with The Carl Fenton Orchestra on a popular CBS radio show.  By 1936, hed replaced his former boss, Whiteman, as the host of NBCs Music Hall, the weekly radio program where he remained for the next ten years. the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day), which also showcased one of his then-trademark whistling interludes, became his theme song and signature tune.Crosbys much-imitated style helped take popular singing beyond the kind of belting associated with boisterous performers like Jolson, who had been obliged to reach the back seats in New York theatres without the aid of the microphone. As Henry Pleasants noted in The Great American Popular Singers, something new had entered American music, a style that might be called singing in American, with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet crooner.thumb|left|220px|Crosby (1942) with golf balls for the Scrap Rubber Drive during World War IICrosby made numerous live appearances before American troops fighting in the European Theater. He also learned how to pronounce German from written scripts, and would read propaganda broadcasts intended for the German forces. The nickname Der Bingle for him was understood to have become current among Crosbys German listeners, and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President Delano Roosevelt, General Eisenhower, and Hope.White ChristmasThe biggest hit of Crosbys career was his recording of Berlins White Christmas, which he introduced through a radio broadcast during the 1942 Christmas season, and the movie Holiday Inn. Crosbys recording hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to #1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times.  It topped the charts again in 1945, and for a third time in January 1947. The song remains the best-selling single of all time.( According to World Records, Crosbys recording of White Christmas has sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50 million sales as singles.() Crosbys recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles.  Though the two versions are very similar, it is the 1947 recording which is most familiar today.  Crosby was dismissive of his role in the songs success, saying later that a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully.Motion picturesSee Crosby filmographyImage:Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Lamour With 1,077,900,000 movie tickets sold, Crosby is by that measure the third most popular actor of all time, behind Gable and Wayne.() The Quigley Publishing Companys International Motion Picture Almanac lists Crosby in a tie for second on the All Time Number One Stars List with Eastwood, Hanks, and Reynolds.() Crosbys most popular film, White Christmas, grossed $30 million in 1954 (${{formatnum:}} million in current value).(  Crosby won an Award for Best Actor for My Way in 1944, and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, Bells of Saint Marys. He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in The Country Girl, and received his third Award nomination.Image:Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in Road to Bali.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Crosby with Hope in to Bali (1952)Crosby starred with Hope in seven  to musical comedies between 1940 and 1962, cementing the two entertainers as an on-and-off duo, despite never officially declaring themselves a team in the sense that and Hardy or Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were teams.  The series consists of to Singapore (1940), to Zanzibar (1941), to Morocco (1942), to Utopia (1946), to Rio (1947), to Bali (1952), and Road to Hong Kong (1962), and Crosby and Hope were planning another entry called The Road to the Fountain of Youth in 1977, which was dropped upon Crosbys death.  Appearing solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other during their various appearances, typically in a comically insulting fashion, and they appeared together countless times on stage, radio, and television over the decades as well as cameos in several additional films.By the late 1950s, Crosbys singing career had evolved into that of an avuncular elder statesman, and his albums Sings Whilst Bregman Swings and With A Beat sold reasonably well,( even in the rock n roll era. In 1960, Crosby starred in High Time, a collegiate comedy with Fabian and Weld that foretold the emerging gap between older Crosby fans and a new generation of films and music.(TelevisionThe Fireside Theater (1950) was Crosbys first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at Hal Roach Studios rather than performed live on the air. The telefilms were syndicated to individual television stations.Crosby was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s. He was especially closely associated with ABCs variety show Hollywood Palace. He was the shows first and most frequent guest host, and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s he made two famous late appearances on the Wilson Show, singing duets with the comedian. Crosbys last TV appearance was a Christmas special filmed in London in September 1977 and aired just weeks after his death.  It was on this special that Crosby recorded a duet of Drummer Boy with the flamboyant rock star Bowie.  It was first released as a single five years later, and has since become a staple of holiday radio, and the final popular hit of Crosbys career.  At the end of the century, TV Guide listed the Crosby-Bowie duet as one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th century television.Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with Studios and later Television Studios, produced a number of television series, including Crosbys own unsuccessful ABC sitcom Bing Crosby Show in the 19641965 season (with co-stars Garland and McHugh).  The company produced two ABC dramas, Casey (19611966) and Breaking Point (19631964), the popular Heroes (19651971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show People (19641965).Singing style and vocal characteristicsCrosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone, rather than using the deep, loud vaudeville style associated with Jolson and others.  Crosbys love and appreciation of jazz music helped bring the genre to a wider mainstream audience.  Within the framework of the novelty singing style of Rhythm Boys, Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was firmly rooted in jazz.  Hed already been introduced to Armstrong and Smith prior to his first appearance on record.  Crosby and Armstrong would remain professionally friendly for decades, notably in the 1956 film High Society, where they sang the duet Now You Has Jazz.  During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931-1934), Crosbys emotional, often pleading style of crooning was extremely popular.  But Jack Kapp (manager of Brunswick and later Decca)  talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms, in favor of a straight-ahead clear vocal style.Crosby also elaborated on a further idea of Jolsons: phrasing, or the art of making a songs lyric ring true. His success in doing so was influential.  I used to tell Sinatra over and over, said Dorsey, theres only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and thats the only thing that ought to for you, too.Vocal critic Henry Pleasants wrote::While the octave B flat to B flat in Bings voice at that time 1930s is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of Dardanella with Armstrong in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.(Pleasants, H. (1985). The Great American Popular Singers.  Simon and Schuster.)Career statisticsCrosbys was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. Although Magazine operated under different methodologies for the bulk of Crosbys career, his chart numbers remain astonishing: 383 chart singles, including 41 #1 hits. Crosby had separate charting singles in every calendar year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of Christmas extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. Billboards statistician Whitburn determined Crosby to be Americas most successful recording act of the 1930s, and again in the 1940s.Image:Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in White Christmas trailer 3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Crosby with Kaye in White Christmas (1954)For 15 years (1934, 1937, 1940, 19431954), Crosby was among the top 10 in box office drawing power, and for five of those years (19441948) he was tops in the world.( He sang four Academy Award-winning songs  Sweet Leilani (1937), White Christmas (1942), on a Star (1944), In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening (1951)  and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in My Way (1944).He collected 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book Million Selling Records. The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958, by which point Crosbys record sales were barely a blip; prior to that point, gold records are awarded by an artists own record company. Universal Music, current owner of Crosbys Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.In 1962, Crosby was given the Lifetime Achievement Award. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music.  In 2007 Crosby was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame, and in 2008 into the Western Music Hall of Fame.()EntrepreneurshipMass mediaCrosbys radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also  reinforced by the musicians union and ASCAP, which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.)  In On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, historian John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional quality standard::saw an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the stars convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldnt stand for canned radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed, and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. Allen, Benny, Harris, and, yes, Crosby were masters at this, and the networks werent about to give it up easily.Crosbys insistence eventually factored into the further development of tape sound recording and the radio industrys widespread adoption of it.(Hammar, Peter. Jack Mullin: The man and his machines. Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 37 (6): 490496, 498, 500, 502, 504, 506, 508, 510, 512; June 1989.)(An afternoon with Jack Mullin. NTSC VHS tape, 1989 AES.)(History of Magnetic tape, section: Enter Bing Crosby (WayBack Machine)) He used his clout, both professional and financial, to innovate new methods of reproducing audio of his performances. But NBC (and competitor CBS) were also insistent, refusing to air prerecorded radio programs.  Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with Kraft, his sponsor, that was settled out of court.  Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 19451946 season.The Mutual network, on the other hand, had pre-recorded some of its programs as early as the 1938 run of Shadow with Welles.  And the new ABC network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old NBC Blue network in 1943 following a federal anti-trust action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by Philco. He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch lacquer/discs that played ten minutes per side at 33 rpm.Crosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the National Park Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason.Though Crosby did want more time to tend his other business and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way; the logistics of mic placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the worlds first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Maid. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldnt tax him at a 77% rate.()The transcription method posed problems, however. The acetate surface coating of the aluminum discs was little better than the wax that Edison had used at the turn of the century, with the same limited dynamic range and frequency response.But MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German Magnetophon in June 1947the same device that Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. M. Poniatoff ordered his Ampex company, which hed founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his Philco Radio Time show on his German-made machine in August 1947, using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at Nauheim near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The crucial advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography::By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didnt play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didnt sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. Wed dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.Mullins 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosbys account: :In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it  thought it was very funny  but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.Crosby invested US$50,000 in Ampex with an eye towards producing more machines. In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was taped with the new Ampex Model 200 tape recorder using the new Scotch 111 tape from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) company. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines: :One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrows script. Today they wouldnt seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldnt use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasnt very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.Crosby had launched the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film Music, Bing Crosby is seen singing into one of the new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else.  Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Hope.Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a recorder (VTR). production was mostly television in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. 1950s The Fireside Theater, sponsored by and Gamble, was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with tape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the telefilms were syndicated to individual stations.Crosby did not remain a producer, but continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), gave the worlds first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as blurred and indistinct images, using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3 mm) audio tape moving at 360 inches (9.1 m) per second.(Tape Recording Used by Filmless Camera, New York Times, Nov. 12, 1951, p. 21.

In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its of Directors.  Operating from the Mar Racetrack at Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman S. Howard, who owned a successful racing stable that included Seabiscuit.  His son, Lindsay Howard, became one of Crosbys closest friends; Crosby named his son Lindsay after him, and would purchase his 40-room Hillsborough estate from Lindsay in 1965. Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed Stable to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in Moorpark in County, California. They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipdromo de Palermo in Buenos Aires. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all race won by Charles S. Howards Seabiscuit over Binglins horse Ligaroti. In 1943, Binglins horse Don Bingo won the Handicap at Park in New York.The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wifes estate.()  The Crosby Breeders Cup Handicap at Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.Crosby was also a co-owner of the British colt Court, with jockey Longdens friend Bell .  Meadow Court won the 1965 George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and the Derby.  In the Irish Derbys winners circle at the Curragh, Crosby sang When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.Though Crosbys stables had some success, he often joked about his horseracing failures as part of his radio appearances.  Crosbys horse finally came in became a running gag.Crosby the sportsmanCrosby had an interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach.(Bing Crosby and Gonzaga University: 1925 - 1951, Gonzaga University, retrieved June 6, 2011.) From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseballs Pirates. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. But Crosby had the NBC telecast of the game recorded on kinescope.  The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by Mazeroskis home run. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009.() The restored broadcast was shown on Network in December 2010.  Crosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the Jones Award, the highest honor given by the States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship.  He is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Since 1937, the Crosby Clambake as it was popularly knownnow the Pebble Beach National Pro-Amhas been a leading event in the world of professional golf. Crosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of King of Jazz.   Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap.  He competed in both the British and U.S. Amateur championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at Cypress Point.Personal lifeCrosby was married twice, first to actress/nightclub singer Lee from 1930 until her death from cancer in 1952. They had four sons: Gary, twins Dennis and Phillip, and Lindsay. The 1947 film The Story of a Woman is indirectly based on her life. After Dixies death, Crosby had relationships with actresses Stevens and Kelly before marrying the actress Kathryn Grant in 1957. They had three children: Harry (who played Bill in Friday the 13th), Mary (best known for portraying Shepard, the woman who shot Ewing on TVs Dallas), and Nathaniel.Kathryn converted to Catholicism in order to marry the singer. Crosby was also a registered Republican, and actively campaigned for Willkie in 1940 against President Roosevelt, arguing that no man should serve more than two terms in the White House. After Willkie lost, Crosby decreed that he would never again make any open political contributions.Crosby reportedly had an alcohol problem in his youth, and may have been dismissed from Paul Whitemans orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking. Voice jazz critic and Crosby biographer Giddins says that Armstrongs influence on Crosby extended to his love of marijuana. Crosby smoked it during his early career when it was still legal, and surprised interviewers in the 1960s and 70s by advocating its decriminalization. According to Giddins, Crosby told his son Gary to stay away from alcohol (It killed your mother(Giddins, 2001, p. 181.)) and suggested he smoke pot instead.( Gary said, There were other times when marijuana was mentioned and hed get a smile on his face.( Gary thought his fathers pot smoking had influenced his easygoing style in his films. Crosby finally quit smoking his pipe following lung surgery in 1974.After Crosbys death, his eldest son, Gary, wrote a highly critical memoir, Going My Own Way, depicting his father as cold, remote, and both physically and psychologically abusive. Two of Crosbys other sons, Lindsay and Dennis, sided with Garys claim and stated Crosby abused them as well.()  Dennis also stated that Crosby would abuse Gary the most often.(  Gary Crosby wrote::We had to keep a close watch on our actions... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it the Crosby lavalier. At the time the humor of the name escaped me...:Satchel Ass or Bucket Butt or My Fat-assed Kid. Thats how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...:When I saw Going My Way I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father OMalley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.()It was revealed that Crosbys will had established a blind trust, with none of the sons receiving an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.()However, younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Garys claims about their father.  Around the time Gary made his claim, Phillip stated to the press that Gary is a whining...crybaby, walking around with a 2-by-4 and just daring people to nudge it off.()  However, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment.(  In an interview with People Magazine, Phillip stated that we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didnt deserve.(  In an interview conducted in 1999 by the Globe, Phillip said::My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him.:To my dying day, Ill hate Gary for dragging Dads name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers.:My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.(Grudens, 2002, p. 59.)Gary Crosby died in 1995 at the age of 62, and 69-year-old Phillip Crosby died in 2004.()  Lindsay and Dennis Crosby each committed suicide, shooting themselves with shotguns in 1989 and 1991, respectively.  Crosby, Crosbys youngest son from his second marriage, was a high-level golfer who won the U.S. Amateur at age 19 in 1981, at the time the youngest-ever winner of that event (a record later broken by Woods).  Harry Crosby is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances. Widow Crosby dabbled in local theater productions intermittently, and appeared in television tributes to her late husband.  Crosby, Dennis Crosbys daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as Yar on Trek: The Next Generation, and for the recurring role of the Romulan Sela (daughter of Tasha Yar) after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of Kings novel Sematary.  In 2006, Crosbys niece, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book Me and Uncle Bing.Failing health and deathImage:Bing Crosby Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|240px |Crosby in 1977, by Warren.Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business and with a horrified Bob Hope looking on, Crosby backed off the stage and fell into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back and requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977; when the power went out, he continued singing without amplification. In September, Crosby, his family, and singer Clooney began a concert tour of England that included two weeks at the Palladium. While in England, Crosby recorded his final album, Seasons, and his final TV Christmas special with guest Bowie. His last concert was in Brighton Centre four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame Fields in attendance. Crosbys last photograph was taken with Fields.Image:Bing Crosby Last Perfromance Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Commemorative Plaque In Brighton Centre foyer At the conclusion of his work in England, Crosby flew alone to Spain to hunt and play golf. Shortly after 6 p.m. on October 14, Crosby collapsed and died of a massive heart attack after a round of 18 holes of golf near Madrid where he and his Spanish golfing partner had just defeated their opponents. It is widely written that his last words were That was a great game of golf, fellas.() In Hopes Confessions of a Hooker: My Lifelong Love Affair With Golf, the comedian recounts hearing that Crosby had been advised by a physician in England to play only nine holes of golf because of his heart condition.LegacyFile:Bing Crosby star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the Walk of Fame at 6769 Hollywood Blvd.He is a member of the Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.( )The family launched an official website() on October 14, 2007, the 30th anniversary of Crosbys death.In his 1990 autobiography Dont Shoot, Its Only Me! Hope wrote, Dear old Bing. As we called him, the Economy-sized Sinatra. And what a voice. God I miss that voice. I cant even turn on the radio around Christmas time without crying anymore.()Calypso musician Lion wrote a tribute song in 1939 entitled Bing Crosby, in which he wrote: Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul / Which captivates the world / His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice / At his golden voice...(Giddins, 2001, pp. 427428.)CompositionsCrosby co-wrote lyrics to 15 songs. His composition At Your Command was no.1 for three weeks on the U.S. pop singles chart beginning on August 8, 1931. Dont Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You was his most successful composition, recorded by Ellington, Sinatra, Monk, Holiday, and Bailey, among others.

Brythonic_languages
The Brythonic or Brittonic languages (, , ) form one of the two branches of the Insular Celtic language family, the other being Goidelic.(History of English: A Sketch of the Origin and Development of the English Language) The name Brythonic was derived by Welsh Celticist Rhys from the Welsh word Brython, meaning an indigenous Briton as opposed to an Anglo-Saxon or Gael. The name Brittonic derives ultimately from the name Prettanike, recorded  by Greek authors for the Isles. Some authors reserve the term Brittonic for the modified later Brythonic languages after about AD 600.The Brythonic languages derive from the British language, spoken throughout Britain south of the of Forth during the Iron Age and Roman period. North of the Forth, the language is considered to be related; it is possible it was a Brythonic language, but it may have been a sister language. In the 4th and 5th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brythonic speech to the continent, most significantly in Brittany. During the next few centuries the language began to split into several dialects, eventually evolving into Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and Cumbric. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric is extinct, having been replaced by Goidelic and English speech. The of Man may also have had a Brythonic language that was replaced with a Goidelic one. By emigration there are also communities of Brythonic language speakers in England, France, and Wladfa, the Welsh settlement in Patagonia.EvidenceKnowledge of the Brythonic languages comes from a variety of sources. For the early languages information is obtained from coins, inscriptions and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.CharacteristicsThe Brythonic branch is also referred to as P-Celtic (like Gaulish) because the Brythonic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme *kw is p as opposed to the Goidelic c. Such nomenclature usually implies an acceptance of the P-Celtic hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis (for a discussion, see languages).Other major characteristics include:*the treatment of -m, -n as -am, -an.*initial s- followed by a vowel was changed to h-**Welsh hen old, hir long, hafal similar**Breton hen ancient, hir long, haval similar**Cornish hen ancient, hir hong, haval similar**Irish sean old, sior long, samail similar*Brythonic retains original nasals before -t**Breton kant hundred vs. Irish cad*sp, sr, sv/sw became f, fr, chw** *swero toy, game became Welsh chwarae and Breton choari** *srokna nostril became Welsh ffroen and Breton froen.*all other initial s- fell before consonants**smeru became Welsh mr marrow**slemon became Welsh llyfn, Cornish leven and Breton levn smooth*w (written u in Latin texts and ou in Greek) became gw in initial position, w internally, where in Gaelic it is f in initial position and disappears internally** windos white became Welsh gwyn, Cornish gwynn, Breton gwenn** wassos servant, young man became Welsh, Cornish and Breton gwas*double plosives transformed into spirants: pp, cc, tt became f, ch (ch), th (z) before a vowel or liquid**cippus > Breton kef tree trunk, Welsh cyff**cattos > Breton kaz, Cornish kath, Welsh cath**bucca > Breton boch, W boch*single voiceless plosives and voiced d, b, and m in an intervocalic position became soft spirants**Welsh dd, th, f v**Breton z, zh, vClassificationThe family tree of the Brythonic languages is as follows:*Insular Celtic**British ancestral to:***Brythonic ancestral to:****Cumbric****Welsh***Southwestern Brythonic ancestral to:****Cornish****BretonBrythonic languages in use today are Welsh, Cornish and Breton. Welsh and Breton have been spoken continuously since they formed. Cornish died out at the end of the 18th century, but has been revived. Also notable are the extinct language Cumbric, and possibly the extinct Pictish although this may be best considered to be a sister of the Brythonic languages. The late H. Jackson argued during the 1950s, from some of the few remaining examples of stone inscriptions, that the Picts may have also used a non-Indo-European language, but some modern scholars of Pictish do not agree.History and originsGaels Brythons Picts.png|thumb|right|250px|Britain & Ireland in the mid-5th century CE, between the Roman withdrawal and the founding of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.The modern Brythonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed Brittonic, British, Common Brythonic, Old Brythonic or Proto-Brythonic, which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Celtic by the 6th century BC.() There are a number of alternative hypotheses, none of which has found wide acceptance. Alinei denies the existence of a pre-Celtic language and says that Celtic languages arrived in the Paleolithic. Oppenheimer has suggested that Belgic invasions in the 1st century BC could have brought a language to Britain.Brythonic languages were probably spoken prior to the Roman invasion at least in the majority of Britain south of the rivers Forth and Clyde, though the of Man later had a Goidelic language, Manx. Northern Scotland mainly spoke Pritennic, which became Pictish, that may have been a Brythonic language. The theory has been advanced (notably by T. F. ORahilly) that part of Ireland spoke a Brythonic language, usually termed Ivernic, before it was displaced by the Q-Celtic language, although the authors Dillon and Chadwick reject this theory as being implausible.During the period of the Roman occupation of Britain (AD 43 to c. 410), Common Brythonic borrowed a large stock of Latin words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain, such as urbanisation and tactics of warfare, and for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for fish in all the Brythonic languages derives from the Latin piscis rather than the native *skos, which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the Usk, ). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brythonic languages. Romano-British is the name for the Latinised form of the language used by Roman authors.It is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period Common Brythonic was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups  Southwestern and Western (in addition we may posit additional dialects, such as Eastern Brythonic, spoken in what is now England, which have left little or no evidence). Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid 6th century the two dialects began to diverge into recognisably separate languages, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh, and the Southwestern into Cornish and its closely related sister language Breton, which was carried from the south west of Great Britain to continental Armorica.  Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brythonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes which were shared occurred in the 6th century.  Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a common Brythonic language ends by AD 600. It is thought that substantial numbers of Britons remained in the expanding area controlled by Anglo-Saxons , but the only information on their language may be obtained from place names. Over time it is thought they gradually adopted the language.The Brythonic languages spoken in what is now Scotland, the of Man and what is now England began to be displaced in the 5th century through the influence of Irish (Scots), Norse and Germanic invaders. The displacement of the languages of Brythonic descent was probably complete in all of this territory, (except Cornwall and the English counties bordering Wales), by the 11th century (date of extinction in various parts of the territory is debated).The regular consonantal changes from Proto-Celtic to the language and language may be summarised in the following table. Where the Welsh and Cornish graphemes have a different value from the corresponding IPA symbols, the IPA equivalent is indicated between slashes. V represents a vowel; C represents a consonant.Remnants in England, Scotland and IrelandPlace names and river namesThe principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the Brythonic languages were displaced is that of toponyms (place names) and hydronyms (river names). There are many Brythonic place names in lowland Scotland and in the parts of England where it is agreed that substantial Brythonic speakers remained (Brythonic names, apart from those of the former Romano-British towns, are scarce over most of England). Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brythonic include London, Penicuik, Perth, Aberdeen, York, Dorchester, Dover and Colchester. Brythonic elements found in England include bre- and bal- for hills, and  carr for a high rocky place, while some such as combe or coomb(e) for a small deep valley and tor for a hill are examples of Brythonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Brythons, such as Dumbarton  from the Gaelic Dn Breatainn meaning Fort of the Britons, or Walton (several) meaning a tun or settlement where walha (Welsh/Brythons) still lived. The number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These names include ones such as Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe.Also river names containing the roots  der- / dar- / dur-  and  -went  E.G.  Derwent, Darwen,Dart,Deer, Adur, Dour,Darent, Went . The Celtic origins seem likely, the meanings more controversial:Some associate  Der- / Dar-  with the Brythonic word for  OAK(S)  (  derv / dervenn in Breton,  derow / derowenn  in Cornish  derw / derwen  in Welsh. Possible but there would have been a lot of oaks around; maybe there was. As to  -went  some claim this to be a word for  valley  or associated with the Celtic word  nant  for river ( like in Welsh ). This seems a very unlikely derivation, as there is no known initial consonantal changes from  n-  to  w- . More likely is that the  Der- / Dar- / Dur-  means  water  c.f.  Dour  in Breton, dowr in Cornish, Dr  in Welsh. and  -(g)wen(n)(t)  means white / pure.Brittonicisms in EnglishSome have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that linguistic effects on English were lexically rather poor aside from toponyms, consisting of a few domestic words, which may include hubbub, dad,  peat, bucket, crock, noggin, gob (cf. Gaelic gob), nook; and the dialectal term for a badger, i.e. brock (cf. Welsh broch, and Gaelic broc). Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system Tan Tethera in the west, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as Cumbria. Several Cornish mining words are still in use in English language mining terminology, such as costean, gunnies, and vug.(Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms by American Geological Institute and U S Bureau of Mines (pages 128, 249, and 613))Those who argue against the theory of a Brythonic substratum and heavy influence point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brythonic language. A notable example is Avon which comes from the Welsh term for river abona(http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?searchAvon&searchmodenone) but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the Ouse, Yorkshire contains the word usa which merely means water(A. Room (ed.) 1992: Brewers Dictionary of Names, Oxford: Helicon, p. 396-7.) and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a trepasser (an over-flowing river)()It has been argued that the use of periphrastic constructions (using verbs like do and be) in the English verb (which is more widespread than in the other languages) is traceable to Brythonic influence although some find this very unlikely and prefer a hypothesis of North Germanic influence rather than Celtic.() For example in literary Welsh we can have Caraf  I love and Yr wyf yn caru  I am loving where the Brythonic syntax is exactly mirrored in English, whereas in the Germanic sister languages of English we only have one form, for example Ich liebe in German. This view is not accepted by many linguists(.((http://www.grsampson.net/QBirthOfEng.html)Some researchers (Filppula et al., 2001)  argue that English syntax reflects more extensive Brythonic influences, although many argued that the influence from Celtic is very minor and that the majority comes from Irish rather than Brythonic.(() For instance, in English questions, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement (arent I?, isnt he?, wont we? etc.). The German nicht wahr? and the French nest-ce pas?, by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brythonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.  This view is far from being generally accepted.((Brythonic effect on the Goidelic languagesFar more notable, but less well known, are the many Brythonic influences on Scottish Gaelic. Like English, periphrastic constructions have come to the fore, but to a much greater degree. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary, than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However some common words such as monadh  Welsh mynydd Cumbric *monidh are particularly evident. Often the Brythonic influence on Scots Gaelic is indicated by considering the Gaelic usage which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brythonic. In particular, the word srath (Anglicised as Strath) is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Brythonic cognate ystrad whose meaning is slightly different.  The effect on Irish has been the loan from British of many Latin-derived words. This has been associated with the Christianisation of Ireland from Britain.ReferencesNotesSources* Aleini M (1996).

Barge
File:Barge on River Thames, London - Dec 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Barges towed by a tugboat on the Thames in London, England, KingdomA barge is a flat-bottomed boat, built mainly for river and canal transport of heavy goods. Some barges are not self-propelled and need to be towed by tugboats or pushed by towboats. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway in the early revolution, but were outcompeted in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of rail.EtymologyImage:PnicheRecyclageFerrailles2008Dele2.jpg|thumb|right|A barge carrying recycling material on Dele channel in Lambersart, FranceBarge is attested from 1300, from French barge, from Latin barga. The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. Bark small ship is attested from 1420, from Old French barque, from Vulgar Latin barca (400 AD). The more precise meaning three-masted ship arose in the 17th century, and often takes the French spelling for disambiguation. Both are probably derived from the Latin barica, from Greek baris Egyptian boat, from Coptic bari small boat, hieroglyphic Egyptian D58-G29-M17-M17-D21-P1 and similar ba-y-r for basket-shaped boat. http://books.google.com/books?id8cMWickoS6oC&pgPA202&lpgPA202&dqegyptian+word+for+boat+Bairi+&sourceweb&otsHyFttihvZr&sigx11WDJZ-M-mACFmJCF-KKanlHvg&hlen By extension, the term embark literally means to board the kind of boat called a barque.The long poles used to maneuver or propel a barge have given rise to the saying I wouldnt touch that subject/thing with a barge pole. This is a variation on the phrase I wouldnt touch that with a length pole.  It appears that the association with barge poles came after the phrase was in use. Modern usage uses a ten-foot pole, but the earliest instances in print involve a forty-foot pole http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?termten, which is improbably long for operating a barge.Types of barges* Admirals barge* barge* float* Crane Barge* barge* bulk cargo barge* barge* barge* Lighter and  Dumb steel lighter* cargo barge* Log barge* Oil barge and Dumb steel oil barge* barge* barge* barge* Row barge* Sand barge* Severn trow* barge* sailing barge* Pudding* Vehicular bargeOn the Great British canal system, the term barge is used to describe a boat wider than a narrowboat, and the people who move barges are often known as lightermen. In the United States, deckhands perform the labor and are supervised by a leadman or the mate. The captain and pilot steer the towboat, which pushes one or more barges held together with rigging, collectively called the tow. The crew live aboard the towboat as it travels along the inland river system or the intracoastal waterways. These towboats travel between ports and are also called line-haul boats.Poles are used on barges to fend off the barge as it nears other vessels or a wharf. These are often called pike poles. On shallow canals in the United Kingdom, long punt poles are used to manoeuvre or propel the barge.Modern useImage:Chicago River towboat and barge 080405.jpg|thumb|right|A towboat pushing a barge on the RiverBarges are used today for low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods by barge is very low.  Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical barge measures 195 by 35 feet (59.4 m  10.6 m), and can carry up to 1,500 tons of cargo.  As an example, on June 26, 2006, a 565-ton catalytic cracking unit reactor was shipped by barge from the Port of Catoosa in Oklahoma to a refinery in Mississippi.  Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled onsite, but shipping an assembled unit reduced costs and avoided reliance on construction labor at the delivery site (which in this case was still recovering from Katrina).  Of the reactors  journey, only about 40 miles were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.Self-propelled barges may be used as such when traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters.  Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.Many barges, primarily Dutch Barges, which were originally designed for carrying cargo along the canals of Europe, are no longer large enough to compete in this industry with larger newer vessels. Many of these barges have been renovated and are now used as luxury Hotel Barges carrying holiday makers along the same canals they once carried grain or coal.Towed or otherwise unpowered barges in the United StatesFile:Cumberland River barge traffic.jpg|thumb|Multiple barges pushed around a tight bend on the River.In primitive regions today and in all pre-development (lacking highways or railways) regions worldwide in times before industrial development and highways, barges were the predominant and most efficient means of inland transportation in many regions of the world. This holds true even today, for many areas of the world. In such pre-industrialized, or poorly developed infrastructure regions, many barges are purpose-designed to be powered on waterways by long slender polesthereby becoming known on American waterways as poleboats as the extensive west of North America was settled using the vast tributary river systems of the Mississippi basin. Poleboats utilize muscle power of walkers along the sides of the craft pushing against a pole against the streambed, canal, or lake bottom to move the vessel where desired. In settling the American west it was generally faster to navigate down River from Pennsylvania, to the River confluence with the Mississippi and then pole up river against the current to St Louis than to travel overland on the rare primitive dirt roads for many decades after the revolution.Once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads reached Chicago, that time dynamic changed, and American poleboats became less common, relegated to smaller rivers and more remote streams. On that Mississippi riverine system today, including that of other sheltered waterways, industrial barge trafficking in bulk raw materials such as coal, coke, timber, iron ore and other minerals is extremely common in the developed world using huge cargo barges that connect in groups and trains-of-barges in ways which allow cargo volumes and weights which would astonish pioneers of modern barge systems and methods in the era.Image:The tugboat, Herbert P. Brake.jpg|thumb|The towboat, Herbert P. Brake, of New York, pushes a new barge East on the Erie Canal in Fairport, York, StatesSuch barges are not self-propelled and need to be towed by tugboats or pushed by towboats. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent towpath were of fundamental importance in the early industrial revolution, whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build viaducts, aqueducts and especially canal to fuel and feed the raw materials to the nascent factories being born in the early industrial takeoff, and take their goods to the ports and cities for distribution.The barge and canal system contended favorably with the railways in the early revolution prior to around the 1850s  60sfor example, the Canal in York State is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for York City to eclipse Philadelphia as Americas largest port and city but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues were eventually outcompeted in the carriage of high-value items by the railways  due to the higher speed, falling costs, and route flexibility of transport. Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after World War I in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the Countries, France, Germany, Poland, and especially Britain which more or less made the system characteristically its own.Image galleryImage:Barge with cars.jpg|Car barge on the RiverImage:Pniches sur le Canal du Midi.jpg|French barges near Toulouse, FranceImage:Hannover binnenschiff voll 01.jpg|Self-propelled barge Andromeda in canal at Hanover, GermanyImage:CrushedStoneBarge.jpg|Self-propelled barge carrying bulk crushed stoneImage:IjmuidenBarge.jpg|Self-propelled barge in the port of IJmuiden, NetherlandsImage:Pegasus_barge_being_moved_by_Freedom_Star_and_towboat_American_2.jpg|Barge carrying the Shuttle external tank for STS-119 under tow to Canaveral, Florida, StatesImage:Horse Drawing Barge on the Kennet and Avon Canal.JPG|Horse drawing a barge on the Kennet and Avon Canal.Image:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-boats-3351.JPG|Self-propelled barges on the Canal of China near Yangzhou, Jiangsu, ChinaImage:CoalbargePittsburgh.JPG|Coal barge passing Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the River.File:Suphannahongsa-docked.jpg|Royal Barge Suphannahong docked at Arun pier, one of the Thai royal barges featured in the royal barge ceremonyImage:Donna York.jpg|The towboat, Donna York, pushing barges of coal up the Ohio river at Louisville, Kentucky, States See also* Barges in TUGS* Burlak* Canal boat Ross Barlow* float* Mining Barge* 4000* American Waterways Operators* Towboat* boatExternal links* Barge Lehigh Valley 79 at the Waterfront Museum, Brooklyn, York, States* Britains Official guide to canals, rivers and lakes* * Crane Barge 89 Ton Design 264B* DBA The Barge Association* The American Waterways Operatorsca:Gavarrada:Pramohne eigenen Antriebet:Praames:Gabarraeu:Gabarrafa:(bateau)gd:Birdseko:hr:Teglenicaid:Tongkangit:Chiatta( )lt:Barams:Bajnl:Sleepschipja:no:Lekterpl:Barkaro:lepru:fi:Proomusv:Prmuk:zh:

Bioinformatics
Image:Genome viewer screenshot small.png|thumbnail|right|220px|Map of the human X chromosome (from the NCBI website). Assembly of the genome is one of the greatest achievements of bioinformatics.Bioinformatics  is the application of science and technology to the field of biology and medicine. Bioinformatics deals with algorithms, databases and information systems, web technologies, artificial intelligence and soft computing, information and computation theory, software engineering, data mining, image processing, modeling and simulation, signal processing, discrete mathematics, control and system theory, circuit theory, and statistics, for generating new knowledge of biology and medicine, and improving & discovering new models of computation (e.g. DNA computing, neural computing, evolutionary computing, immuno-computing, swarm-computing, cellular-computing). Java, XML, Perl, C, C++, Python, R, SQL and MatLab are the some of the more prominent software technologies used in this field. IntroductionBioinformatics was applied in the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological information at the beginning of the genomic revolution, such as nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Development of this type of database involved not only design issues but the development of complex interfaces whereby researchers could both access existing data as well as submit new or revised data.In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data, including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures. The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as computational biology. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:* the development and implementation of tools that enable efficient access to, and use and management of, various types of information.* the development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistics with which to assess relationships among members of large data sets, such as methods to locate a gene within a sequence, predict protein structure and/or function, and cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences.The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques (e.g., recognition,  mining, learning algorithms, and visualization) to achieve this goal. Major research efforts in the field include alignment, finding, assembly, design, discovery, protein structure alignment, structure prediction, prediction of expression and interactions, association studies and the modeling of evolution.The term bioinformatics was coined by Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1978 for the study of informatic processes in biotic systems.()() Its primary use since at least the late 1980s has been in genomics and genetics, particularly in those areas of genomics involving large-scale sequencing.Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. It is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing DNA and protein sequences, aligning different DNA and protein sequences to compare them and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.There are two fundamental ways of modelling a Biological system (e.g. living cell) both coming under Bioinformatic approaches.*Static**Sequences  Proteins, Nucleic acids and Peptides**Structures  Proteins, Nucleic acids, Ligands (including metabolites and drugs) and Peptides**Interaction data among the above entities including microarray data and Networks of proteins, metabolites*Dynamic**Systems Biology comes under this category including reaction fluxes and variable concentrations of metabolites**Multi-Agent Based modelling approaches capturing cellular events such as signalling, transcription and reaction dynamicsA broad sub-category under bioinformatics is bioinformatics.Major research areasSequence analysisSince the Phage -X174 was sequenced in 1977,() the sequences of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode polypeptides (proteins), RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a species or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of systematics to construct trees). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today, programs such as BLAST are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion nucleotides.() These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this alignment is used in the sequencing process itself. The so-called sequencing technique (which was used, for example, by Institute for Genomic Research to sequence the first bacterial genome, influenzae)() does not produce entire chromosomes, but instead generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the genome, it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly will usually contain numerous gaps that have to be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.Another aspect of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is annotation, which involves computational finding to search for protein-coding genes, RNA genes, and other functional sequences within a genome. Not all of the nucleotides within a genome are part of genes. Within the genome of higher organisms, large parts of the DNA do not serve any obvious purpose. This so-called DNA may, however, contain unrecognized functional elements. Bioinformatics helps to bridge the gap between genome and proteome projects  for example, in the use of DNA sequences for protein identification.Genome annotationIn the context of genomics, annotation is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. The first genome annotation software system was designed in 1995 by Dr. Owen White, who was part of the team at Institute for Genomic Research that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free-living organism to be decoded, the bacterium influenzae. Dr. White built a software system to find the genes (places in the DNA sequence that encode a protein), the transfer RNA, and other features, and to make initial assignments of function to those genes. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA are constantly changing and improving.Computational evolutionary biologybiology is the study of the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time. Informatics has assisted evolutionary biologists in several key ways; it has enabled researchers to:* trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their DNA, rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,* more recently, compare entire genomes, which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as duplication, gene transfer, and the prediction of factors important in bacterial speciation,* build complex computational models of populations to predict the outcome of the system over time* track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organismsFuture work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex tree of life.The area of research within science that uses algorithms is sometimes confused with evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related.Literature analysisThe growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed subfields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:* abbreviation recognition - identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms,* named entity recognition - recognizing biological terms such as gene names* protein-protein interaction - identify which proteins interact with which proteins from textThe area of research uses statistics and linguistics, and is substantially influenced by them.Analysis of gene expressionThe expression of many genes can be determined by measuring mRNA levels with multiple techniques including microarrays, expressed cDNA sequence tag (EST) sequencing, analysis of gene expression (SAGE) tag sequencing, parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), RNA-Seq, also known as Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate signal from noise in high-throughput gene expression studies. Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous epithelial cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.Analysis of regulationRegulation is the complex orchestration of events starting with an extracellular signal such as a hormone and leading to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more proteins. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process. For example, analysis involves the identification and study of motifs in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare microarray data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the cycle, along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply clustering algorithms to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented elements.Analysis of protein expressionmicroarrays and high throughput (HT) spectrometry (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected.Analysis of mutations in cancerIn cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called genomic hybridization), and polymorphism arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors.Comparative genomicsThe core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Chain Monte Carlo algorithms for analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.Many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein families computation.Modeling biological systemsSystems biology involves the use of simulations of cellular subsystems (such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes which comprise metabolism, transduction pathways and regulatory networks) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. life or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.High-throughput image analysisComputational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content imagery. Modern image analysis systems augment an observers ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving accuracy, objectivity, or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both diagnostics and research. Some examples are:* high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization (screening, cytohistopathology, informatics)* morphometrics* clinical image analysis and visualization* determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals* quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury* making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals* infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination* inferring clone overlaps in DNA mapping, e.g. the scoreStructural Bioinformatic ApproachesPrediction of protein structureProtein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The acid sequence of a protein, the so-called structure, can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the spongiform encephalopathy  a.k.a. Cow Disease  prion.) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. For lack of better terms, structural information is usually classified as one of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. As of now, most efforts have been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of homology. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene A, whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene B, whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share As function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called homology modeling, this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes (leghemoglobin). Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes.Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and de novo (from scratch) physics-based modeling.See also: motif and domain.Molecular InteractionEfficient software is available today for studying interactions among proteins, ligands and peptides. Types of interactions most often encountered in the field include  Proteinligand (including drug), proteinprotein and proteinpeptide.Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms, termed docking algorithms for studying molecular interactions.See also: interaction prediction.Docking algorithmsIn the last two decades, tens of thousands of protein three-dimensional structures have been determined by crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (protein NMR). One central question for the biological scientist is whether it is practical to predict possible proteinprotein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without doing interaction experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the docking problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.Software and toolsSoftware tools for bioinformatics range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various bioinformatics companies or public institutions.Open source bioinformatics softwareMany and open source software tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s.() The combination of a continued need for new algorithms for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative silico experiments, and freely available code bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported plug-ins in commercial applications. They may also provide facto standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.  The range of open source software packages includes titles such as Bioconductor, BioPerl, BioJava, Bioclipse, EMBOSS, workbench, and UGENE. In order to maintain this tradition and create further opportunities, the non-profit Bioinformatics Foundation( have supported the annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) since 2000.()Web services in bioinformaticsSOAP and REST-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the EBI into three categories: SSS (Sequence Search Services), MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) and BSA (Biological Sequence Analysis). The availability of these service-oriented bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible workflow management systems.See alsoReferencesFurther reading* Achuthsankar S Nair Computational Biology & Bioinformatics  A gentle Overview, Communications of Computer Society of India, January 2007* Aluru, Srinivas, ed.

Brown_bear
 range_map_caption  Ursus arctos range map.The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear distributed across much of northern Eurasia and America. It can weigh from  and its largest subspecies, the Bear, rivals the bear as the largest member of the bear family( (Overview page)) and as the largest land-based predator.()There are several recognized subspecies within the brown bear species. In North America, two types are generally recognized, the coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly, and the two types could broadly define all brown bear subspecies. Grizzlies weigh as little as 350 lb (159 kg) in Yukon, while a brown bear, living on a steady, nutritious diet of spawning salmon, from coastal Alaska and Russia can weigh 1,500 lb (682 kg). The exact number of overall brown subspecies remains in debate.While the brown bears range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a concern species by the IUCN, with a total population of approximately 200,000. Its principal range countries are Russia, the States (mostly in Alaska), Canada, the Carpathian region (especially Romania, but also Ukraine, Slovakia, and so on), the Balkans, Sweden and Finland, where it is the national animal. The brown bear is the most widely distributed of all bears.Naming and etymologyThe brown bear is sometimes referred to as the bruin, from English, based on the name of the bear in History of the Fox, translated by Caxton, from Dutch bruun or bruyn, meaning brown (the color).(American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.) During the West, the grizzly was termed Old Ephraim and sometimes as Moccasin Joe.(Hunting the Grisly and other Sketches. Fullbooks.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-15.)Taxonomy and evolutionBrown bears are thought to have evolved from Ursus etruscus. The oldest fossils occur in China from about 0.5 million years ago. They entered Europe about 250,000 years ago, and North Africa shortly after. Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the Isles, where it is thought they outcompeted bears. The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000 years ago.( It is thought brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger simus.( Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: grizzlies are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula. Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.(Bruce McLellan and David C. Reiner (1994). A Review of bear evolution Int. Conf. Bear Res. and Manage. 9(1):8596)SubspeciesThere is little agreement on classification of brown bears. Some systems have proposed as many as 90 subspecies, while recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five clades.() DNA analysis recently revealed that the identified subspecies of brown bears, both Eurasian and North American, are genetically quite homogeneous, and that their genetic phylogeography does not correspond to their traditional taxonomy.() As of 2005, 16 subspecies have been recognized.() The subspecies have been listed as follows:HybridsA grizzlypolar bear hybrid (known as a pizzly Bear or grolar bear) is a rare hybrid resulting from a union of a brown bear and a bear. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the DNA of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the Canadian arctic.()()() Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos, and was considered a cryptid (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild). Formerly considered subspecies Physical descriptionBrown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach  and sometimes  along the curve.(Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol.II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), V.G Heptner and N.P Naumov editors, Science Publishers, Inc. USA. 1998. ISBN 1-886106-81-9) They are generally dark with a light tip, with some forms having completely light claws.( Brown bear claws are longer and straighter than those of American black bears.(Bear Anatomy and Physiology from Gary Browns The Great Bear Almanac, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993) The claws are blunt, while those of a black bear are sharp.Adults have massive, heavily built concave skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The forehead is high and rises steeply.( The projections of the skull are well developed when compared to those of black bears: the latter have crests not exceeding more than 1920% of the total length of the skull, while the former have sagittal crests comprising up to 4041% of the skulls length. Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The braincase is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions.( Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears.( Skull lengths of Russian bears tend to be  for males, and  for females. The width of the arches in males is , and  in females.( Brown bears have very strong teeth: the incisors are relatively big and the teeth are large, the lower ones being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age.( Although they have powerful jaws, brown bear jaws are incapable of breaking large bones with the ease of hyenas.()The dimensions of brown bears fluctuate very greatly according to sex, age, individual, geographic location, and season. The normal range of physical dimensions for a brown bear is a head-and-body length of  and a shoulder height of . The tail is relatively short, ranging from  in length.(http://www.zoo.org/animal-facts/brownbear (2011).) The smallest subspecies is the brown bear (U. a. arctos), whose mature females weigh as little as .(Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc (1983), ISBN 978-0-85112-235-9) Barely larger, bears (U. a. horribilis) from the Yukon region (which are a third smaller than most grizzlies) can weigh as little as  in the spring(The Bear Facts  Types of bears in the Yukon, Yukon Education Student Network) and the brown bear (U. a. syriacus), with mature females weighing as little as . The largest subspecies are the bear (U. a. middendorffi) and the brown bear (U. a. beringianus), although bears from other coastal regions of eastern Asia and western North America can be comparably large. It is not unusual for large males in coastal regions to stand over  tall while on their hind legs and to weigh up to .() The heaviest recorded brown bear weighed over .( Most brown bears fall somewhere between these extreme high and low weights, although even the relatively small brown bear can weigh up to .()Brown bears have long, thick fur, with a moderately long mane at the back of the neck. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver tips, while in China, brown bears are bicolored with a yellow-brown or whitish cape across the shoulders. North American grizzlies can be dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish brown. Black hairs usually have white tips.( The winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach  at the withers. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, and its length and density varies geographically.(Distribution and habitatThere are about 200,000 brown bears in the world. The largest populations are in Russia with 120,000, the United States with 32,500, and Canada with 21,750. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in Alaska, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly but steadily along the Rockies and the western Plains. Although many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in Mexico and the Mountains of Morocco, both are almost certainly extinct. The last Mexican brown bear was shot in 1960. In Europe, there are 14,000 brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from Spain (estimated at only 20-25 animals in the Pyrenees in 2010,()() in a range shared between France, Spain and Andorra, and some 85-90 animals in Asturias, Cantabria, Galicia and Len, in the de Europa and adjacent areas in 2003() and some 100 animals in 2005() in the west, to Russia in the east, and from Sweden and Finland in the north to Romania (40005000), Bulgaria (9001200), Slovakia (with about 600800 animals), Slovenia (500-700 animals)(http://www.medvedi.si/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id69&Itemid86 ) and Greece (with about 200 animals) in the south. They are extinct in the Isles, extremely threatened in France and Spain, and in trouble over most of Europe. The Carpathian brown bear population of Romania is the largest in Europe outside Russia, estimated at 4,500 to 5,000 bears, although declining alarmingly due to overhunting.() There is also a smaller brown bear population in the Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine (estimated at about 200 in 2005), Slovakia and Poland (estimated at about 100 in 2009 in the latter country).() The total Carpathian population is estimated at about 8,000.() Europe is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,3502,900) in Sweden, about 1,600 in Finland,() about 700 in Estonia and 70 in Norway. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,5003,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria and Greece.(Bear Online Information System for Europe. Kora.ch. Retrieved on 2011-09-15.)Brown bears were once native to Asia, the Mountains in Africa, Europe, and America,() but are now extinct in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. They prefer semiopen country, usually in mountainous areas.Brown bears live in Alaska, east through the Yukon and Territories, south through Columbia and through the western half of Alberta. Small populations exist in the Yellowstone Ecosystem of northwest Wyoming (with about 600 animals), the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of northwest Montana (with about 750 animals), the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem of northwest Montana and northeast Idaho (with about 3040 animals), the Selkirk Ecosystem of northeast Washington and northwest Idaho (with about 4050 animals), and the North Cascades Ecosystem of northcentral Washington (with about 510 animals). These five ecosystems combine for a total of roughly 1,470 wild grizzlies still persisting in the contiguous United States. Unfortunately, these populations are isolated from each other, inhibiting any genetic flow between ecosystems. This poses one of the greatest threats to the future survival of the grizzly bear in the contiguous United States.In Asia, brown bears are found in most of Russia, parts of the East, and in a small area of Manchuria in China. They can also be found on the island of Hokkaid in Japan, western China, and parts of Korea, Afghanistan and India. The population of brown bears in the Pyrenees mountain range between France and Spain is so low, estimated at 14 to 18, with a shortage of females, that bears, mostly female, from Slovenia were released in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species presence in the area, despite protests from French farmers.A small population of brown bears (arctos marsicanus) still lives in central Italy (Apennine mountains, Abruzzo and Latium), with no more than 70 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.In Arctic areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing. The warming of that region has allowed the species to move farther north into what was once exclusively the domain of the bear. In non-Arctic areas, habitat loss is blamed as the leading cause of endangerment, followed by hunting.North American brown bears, or bears, seem to prefer open landscapes, whereas in Eurasia they inhabit mostly dense forests. It is thought the Eurasian bears which colonized America were tundra-adapted. This is indicated by brown bears in the Peninsula on the Asian side of Bering Strait, which are the only Asian brown bears to live year-round in lowland tundra like their North American cousins.()BehaviorThe brown bear is primarily nocturnal. In the summer, it gains up to  of fat, on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic. Although they are not full hibernators, and can be woken easily; both sexes like to den in a protected spot, such as a cave, crevice, or hollow log, during the winter months. Brown bears are mostly solitary, although they may gather in large numbers at major food sources and form social hierarchies based on age and size.() Adult male bears are particularly aggressive and are avoided by adolescent and subadult males. Female bears with cubs rival adult males in aggression, and are more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive, and have been observed in nonagonistic interactions with each other. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing off canines, muzzle twisting and neck stretching to which a subordinate will respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or laying down.(DEREK STONOROV and ALLEN W. STOKES (1972) Social Behavior of the Alaska Brown Bear PANEL 4: BEAR BEHAVIOUR) During combat, bears use their paws to strike their opponents in the chest or shoulders and bite the head or neck. In his Great Bear Almanac, Gary Brown lists 11 different sounds bears produce in 9 different contexts. Sounds expressing anger or aggravation include growls, roars, woofs, champs and smacks, while sounds expressing nervousness or pain include woofs, grunts and bawls. Sows will bleat or hum when communicating with their cubs.(ReproductionThe mating season is from late May to early July. Being serially monogamous, brown bears remain with the same mate from several days to a couple of weeks.(Types of Bears  Information on Specific Bear Species (2009)) Females mature sexually between the age of 5 and 7 years, while males usually mate a few years later, when they are large and strong enough to successfully compete with other males for mating rights.File:4466 - Bern - Brengraben - Mating Ursus arctos.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A pair of mating brown bears, at the Brengraben in Bern, Switzerland Males, however, take no part in raising their cubs  parenting is left entirely to the females.Through the process of implantation, a females fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the uterine wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. The average litter has one to four cubs, usually two. There have been cases of bears with five cubs, although females sometimes adopt stray cubs. Older females tend to give birth to larger litters. The size of a litter also depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, the cubs are blind, toothless, hairless, and weigh less than . They feed on their mothers milk until spring or even early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh  and have developed enough to follow her and begin to forage for solid food.Cubs remain with their mother from two to four years, during which time they learn survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional values and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mothers actions during the period they are with her.() Brown bears practice infanticide.() An adult male bear may kill the cubs of another bear either to make the female sexually receptive or simply for consumption. Cubs flee up a tree when they see a strange male bear, and the mother defends them, even though the male may be twice her size.Dietary habitsFile:Brown Bear Feeding on Salmon.jpg|thumb|150px|Brown bear feeding on salmonThey are omnivores and feed on a variety of plant products, including berries, roots, and sprouts, and fungi, as well as meat products such as fish, insects, and small mammals. Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary energy from vegetable matter.() Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity. For example, bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of moths during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 in a day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects.() In the Kamchatka peninsula and parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning salmon, whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas, though, these bears very rarely hunt large animals. Brown bears also occasionally prey on large mammals, such as deer (including elk, moose and caribou), sheep, goats, bison and muskoxen. When brown bears attack these animals, they tend to choose the young ones, as they are easier to catch. When hunting, the bear pins its prey to the ground and then tears and eats it alive.() On rare occasions, bears kill by hitting their prey with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large prey, such as moose. They also feed on carrion, and use their size to intimidate other predators, such as wolves, cougars, tigers, and bears from their kills.Interspecific predatory relationshipsFile:Wolfbear.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear being followed by a wolfBrown bears often use their large size for intimidation when a kill or a territory is in dispute with another large predator and they are normally dominant in such interactions. Sometimes, the conflict will escalate to the point of violence, but usually threat displays are sufficient, since most animals try to avoid potential bodily harm. However, the massive strength and size of the brown bear will usually result in it winning violent conflicts, even against wolf packs and Siberian Tigers. In situations where the interspecies conflict turns deadly, brown bears may also eat the competitor, despite it not being the primary reason for attack.Brown bears regularly intimidate wolves away from their kills. In National Park, brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstones Wolf Project Director Doug Smith wrote, Its not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. Given the opportunity, both species prey on the others cubs.() Conclusively, the individual power of the bear against the collective strength of the wolf pack usually results in a long battle for kills or domination. In some areas, the brown bear also regularly displaces cougars from their kills.()Adult bears are generally immune from predatory attacks from anything other than other bears. Some bears emerging from hibernation seek tigers to steal their kills.() Indeed, Russian researchers have identified satellite bears who follow tigers over extensive periods of time, sequentially usurping kills; these bears were observed tracking tigers in spring snow and regularly usurped their kills.( In the Far East, brown bears along with smaller black bears constitute 58% of the diet of tigers. In particular, the brown bears input is estimated to be 1.01.5% in one source.(Vratislav Mazak: Der Tiger. Nachdruck der 3. Auflage von 1983. Westarp Wissenschaften Hohenwarsleben, 2004 ISBN 3-89432-759-6) However, another source states that such attacks are rare and do not have any actual significance because Siberian tigers are almost extinct. Siberian tigers most typically attack brown bears in the winter in the hibernaculum( V.G. Heptner and N.P. Naumov. Mammals of the Soviet Union. Vol. 2 IIa 1998. New Delhi, India: Amerind Publishing. pp. 670-1) or in the late autumn and early spring, and when ungulate populations decrease.( Adult bears, generally smaller ones, are sometimes vulnerable to tiger attacks and have been killed in their dens in winter, with the tiger taking advantage of the bears hibernating condition.() There are also records of bears killing tigers, including fully grown adult males and tigers whose sex and age were not specified,(Mammals of the Soviet Union Volume II, by V.G Heptner & A.A. Sludskii p. 177) either in self-defense, or in disputes over kills or for consumption.(Seryodkin, I. V., J. M. Goodrich, A. V. Kostyrya, B. O. Schleyer, E. N. Smirnov, L. L. Kerley, and D. G. Miquelle. 2005. Relationship between tigers, brown bears, and Himalayan black bears. pp. 156163 in D. G. Miquelle, E. N. Smirnov, and J. M. Goodrich (eds.), Tigers of Sikhote-Alin Zapovednik: Ecology and Conservation. Vladivostok, Russia: PSP.)()(Kerley, Linda; Goodrich, John, and Miquelle, Dale. Bears and tigers in the Far East International Bear News. 5 (2): p. 4.)Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, black bears are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bears diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bears largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces.() Brown bears may attack black bears.() They will eat the fruit dropped by the latter species from trees, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb.(The Intellectual observer: review of natural history, microscopic research, and recreative science, published by Groombridge., 1865)There has been a recent increase in interactions between brown bears and bears, theorized to be caused by change. Brown bears have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears. Brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses,(Dough OHara Polar bears, grizzlies increasingly gather on North Slope. Anchorage Daily News. April 24, 2005 ) and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens.()Relationship with humansFile:BrenspurP1050395.jpg|thumb|Front paw imprintBears become attracted to human-created food sources, such as garbage dumps, litter bins, and dumpsters; they venture into human dwellings or barns in search of food as humans encroach into bear habitats. In the U.S., bears sometimes kill and eat farm animals. When bears come to associate human activity with a food reward, they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. The saying, a fed bear is a dead bear, has come into use to popularize the idea that allowing bears to scavenge human garbage, such as trash cans and campers backpacks, food, or other food sources that draw the bear into contact with humans, can result in a bears death.Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bears newly-learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear.()National Park, an enormous reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already endangered species. The grizzly bear is officially described as threatened in the U.S. Though the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.In Europe, part of the problem lies with shepherds; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using dogs to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available, and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear.Legal status* The grizzly bear, sometimes called the silvertip bear, is listed as threatened in the United States. It is slowly repopulating in areas where it was previously extirpated, though it is still vulnerable.* The California golden bear (Ursus arctos californicus()) disappeared from the state of California in 1922, when the last one was shot in Tulare County. It is the official state animal.()* The Mexican grizzly bear is listed as an species, but it may be extinct.* In Canada, it is listed as vulnerable in Alberta, British Columbia, Northwest Territories, and Yukon Territory. Prairie populations of grizzly bear are listed as extirpated in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.* The brown bear is a Protected Species, given protection throughout the Union.* The brown bear is also the national animal of Finland.* The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 kuna coin, minted since 1993.Bear encountersThere are an average of two fatal attacks by bears per year in North America.(Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance, Herrero, revised edition, 2002.) In Scandinavia, there are only four known cases since 1902 of bear encounters which have resulted in death. The two most common causes for bear attack are surprise and curiosity.() Some types of bears, such as polar bears, are more likely to attack humans when searching for food, while black bears are much less likely to attack.The Alaska Science Center ranks the following as the most likely reasons for bear attacks:(# Surprise# Curiosity# Invaded personal space (this includes a mother bear protecting her young)# Predatory intent# Hunting wounded# Carcass defense# Provoked chargeAggressive behavior in brown bears is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult brown bears are too large to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female brown bears in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age.(Why are grizzly bears more aggressive than our black bears?. Digital Collegian. April 27, 2004) Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of brown bear-caused human fatalities in North America.(Lynn L. Rogers How Dangerous are Black Bears)Attacks on humansFile:Bear trap GTNP1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A drum or barrel trap used to safely relocate bears parked adjacent to a building in Teton National Park in Wyoming in the StatesAs a rule, brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and will attack if they are surprised or feel threatened.(Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance by Stephen Herrero, Hurtig Publishers Ltd./ Edmonton 1985) Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. Habituated or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with only one known case of an attack on a group of six or more. In that instance, it is thought that due to surprise the bear may not have recognized the size of the group.(Alaska bear attack: NOLS kids did a phenomenal job, Craig Medred, Dispatch, 26 July 2011) In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death.( In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound,( and seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to disarm their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn.( Due to the bears enormous physical strength, even a single bite or swipe can be deadly, as in tigers, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite.(The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations Volume 1: Mammals, by Cornish, C.

Retrieved on 2011-09-15.) Most attacks occur in the months of July, August and September, the time when the number of outdoor recreationalists, such as hikers or hunters, is higher. People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back.(Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the Soviet Union, though exceptions exist in districts where they are not pursued by hunters.( Siberian bears, for example, tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts.(WOLVES, BEARS AND HUMAN ANTI-PREDATOR ADAPTATIONS) In 2008, a platinum mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 bears, who killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes.(Bears besiege Russian mine after killing guards.

In Scandinavia, only three fatal attacks were recorded in the 20th century.()In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed Kesagake (, kesa-style slasher) made history for causing the worst bear attack in Japanese history at Hokkaid during numerous encounters in December, 1915. It killed seven people (including one pregnant woman) and wounded three others (with possibly another three previous fatalities to its credit) before being gunned down after a large-scale beast-hunt. Today, there is still a shrine at Rokusensawa (), where the event took place, in memory of the victims of the incident.Native American tribes sympatric to brown bears often viewed them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives, they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act was done with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 410 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies.(Valerius Geist Did Large Predators keep Humans out of North America?.

Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through to the 1950s, though it increased to four per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to one injury every two years during the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2002, there have been only two human injuries caused by grizzly bears in a developed area. Though grizzly attacks were rare in the backcountry before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately one per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.(Bear Caused Human Injuries and Deaths In Yellowstone National Park.

Solid shotgun slugs, or three buckshot rounds, or a semiautomatic pistol of .45 caliber or more is suggested if a heavy hunting rifle is not available. Guns remain a viable, last resort option to be used in defense of life from aggressive bears.() Too often, people do not carry a proper caliber weapon to neutralize the bear. According to the Alaska Science Center, a 12 gauge shotgun with slugs has been the most effective weapon. There have been fewer injuries as a result of only carrying lethal loads in the shotgun, as opposed to deterrent rounds. State of Alaska Defense of Life or Property (DLP) laws require one to report the kill to authorities, and salvage the hide, skull, and claws.()Campers are often told to wear bright colored red ribbons and bells, and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly scat in camping areas, and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly scat is difficult to differentiate from black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bears carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources website states, Select a gun that will stop a bear (12-gauge shotgun or .300 mag rifle).CultureMany Native American tribes both respected and feared the brown bear, even thinking of it as a god.(Native American Animal Symbols  The Bear.
