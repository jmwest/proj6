Alfred Bernhard Nobel () (21 October 1833  10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, innovator, and armaments manufacturer.  He is the inventor of dynamite.  Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. In his last will, he used his enormous fortune to institute the Prizes. The element nobelium was named after him. His name also survives in modern-day companies such as Nobel and Nobel, which are descendents of the companies Nobel himself established.

Personal background
Alfred Nobel was the third son of Nobel (18011872) and Andriette Ahlsell Nobel (18051889). Through his father he was a descendant of the famous Swedish scientist Olof Rudbeck (1630-1702).  Born in Stockholm on 21 October 1833, he went with his family to Petersburg in 1842, where his father (who had invented modern plywood) started a torpedo works. Alfred studied chemistry with Professor Nikolaevich Zinin. When Alfred was 18, he went to the United States to study chemistry for four years and worked for a short period under Ericsson.(Carlisle, Rodney (2004). Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries, p. 256. John Wiley & Songs, Inc., New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-24410-4.) who designed the American Civil War ironclad Monitor.  In 1859, the factory was left to the care of the second son, Nobel (18311888), who greatly improved the business. Alfred, returning to Sweden with his father after the bankruptcy of their family business, devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerine (discovered in 1847 by Sobrero, one of his fellow students under Pelouze at the of Turin). A big explosion occurred on the 3 September 1864 at their factory in Heleneborg in Stockholm, killing five people.  Among them was Alfreds younger brother Emil.

Though Nobel remained unmarried, his biographers note that he had at least three loves. Nobels first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra, who rejected his proposal. In 1876 Austro-Bohemian Countess Bertha Kinsky became Alfred Nobels secretary. But after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize, for her sincere peace activities.

Nobels third and longest-lasting love was with a flower girl named Sofie Hess from Vienna. This liaison lasted for 18 years and in many of the exchanged letters, Nobel addressed his love as Madame Sofie Nobel. After his death, according to his biographers  Evlanoff and Fluor, and Fant  Nobels letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm and became the best-kept secret of the time. They were released only in 1955, to be included with the biographical data of Nobel.

The foundations of the Nobel Prize were laid in 1895 when Alfred Nobel wrote his last will, leaving much of his wealth for its establishment. Since 1901, the prize has honored men and women for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and for work in peace.

Sri Kantha has suggested that the one personal trait of Nobel that helped him to sharpen his creativity include his talent for information access, via his multi-lingual skills. Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: Swedish, French, Russian, English, German and Italian. He also developed literary skills to write poetry in English. His Nemesis, a prose tragedy in four acts about Cenci, partly inspired by Bysshe Shelleys Cenci, was printed while he was dying. The entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. The first surviving edition (bilingual SwedishEsperanto) was published in Sweden in 2003. The play has been translated to Slovenian via the Esperanto version and to French.() In 2010 it was published in Russia as another bilingual (RussianEsperanto) edition. 

Nobel was elected a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an doctorate from University in 1893.

Alfred Nobel is buried in begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

Inventions


Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as dynamite. Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance Nobels Safety Powder, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for power.

Nobel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. Gelignite, or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the Age of Engineering bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An off-shoot of this research resulted in Nobels invention of ballistite, the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

The Prizes


In 1888 Alfreds brother Ludvig died while visiting Cannes and a French newspaper erroneously published Alfreds obituary. It condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated  (The merchant of death is dead) and went on to say, Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday. Alfred was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered. On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the Prizes, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. He died of a stroke on 10 December 1896 at Sanremo, Italy. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobels will gave 31,225,000 kronor (equivalent to about 1.8 billion kronor or 250 million US dollars in 2008) to fund the prizes.

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence in physical science, in chemistry and in medical science or physiology; the fourth is for literary work in an ideal direction and the fifth prize is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international fraternity, in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses. There is no prize awarded for mathematics,() but see Prize.

The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work in an ideal direction ( in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted ideal as idealistic () and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less Romantic authors, such as Ibsen and Tolstoy. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, Fo and Saramago, who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists and not to engineers, technicians or other inventors.

In 2001, Alfred Nobels great-grandnephew, Peter Nobel (b. 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given in Alfred Nobels memory from the five other awards. This has caused much controversy whether the of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is actually a Nobel Prize / Peace Prize.

File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|280px|The Sphinx and the of Giza are among the most recognizable symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt.



Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BC (according to Egyptian chronology)() with the political unification of and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh.(Dodson (2004) p. 46)  The of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods. The Kingdom of the Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Bronze Age and the Kingdom of the Bronze Age. Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the period, after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was conquered by a succession of foreign powers in this late period. In the aftermath of the Greats death, one of his generals, Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Dynasty ruled Egypt until 30 BC, when it fell to the Empire and became a Roman province.(Clayton (1994) p. 217)

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River Valley. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which fueled development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a Pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.(James (2005) p. 8)(Manuelian (1998) pp. 67)

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that facilitated the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships,( faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty.(Clayton (1994) p. 153) Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travellers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.(James (2005) p. 84)

History



The Nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history.(Shaw (2002) pp. 17, 6769) The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.(Shaw (2002) p. 17)  Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120 thousand years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the region.

Predynastic period


In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated.( )

By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper Egypt, the Badari, was known for its high quality ceramics, tools, and its use of copper.(Hayes (1964) p. 220)

In Northern Egypt, the Badari was followed by Amratian and Gerzean cultures,(Childe, V. Gordon (1953), New light on the most ancient Near East (Praeger Publications)) which brought a number of technological improvements. In Gerzian times, early evidence exists of contact with Canaan and the Byblos coast.(Patai, Raphael (1998), Children of Noah: Jewish Seafaring in Ancient Times (Princeton Uni Press))

In southern Egypt, the Naqada culture, similar to the Badari, began to expand along the Nile by about 4000 BC. As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes.(Barbara G. Aston, James A. Harrell, Ian Shaw (2000). Paul T. Nicholson and Ian Shaw editors. Stone, in Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology, Cambridge, 577, pp. 4647. Also note: Barbara G. Aston (1994). Ancient Egyptian Stone Vessels, Studien zur Archologie und Geschichte Altgyptens 5, Heidelberg, pp. 2326. (See on-line posts: http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/stone/obsidian.html and http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/foreignrelations/obsidian.html.)) Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley.() Establishing a power center at Hierakonpolis, and later at Abydos, Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile.(Shaw (2002) p. 61) They also traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the western desert to the west, and the cultures of the Mediterranean to the east.(  Royal Nubian burials at Qustul produced artifacts bearing the oldest known examples of Egyptian dynastic symbols, such as the white crown of Egypt and falcon.()() 

The Naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods, reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines.() During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually evolved into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.(Allen (2000) p. 1)

Early Dynastic Period
The 3rd century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of pharaohs from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today.(Clayton (1994) p. 6) He chose to begin his official history with the king named Meni (or Menes in Greek) who was then believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Egypt (around 3100 BC).(Shaw (2002) pp. 7880) The transition to a unified state actually happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have actually been the pharaoh Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette in a symbolic act of unification.(Clayton (1994) pp. 1213) In the Early Dynastic Period about 3150 BC, the first of the Dynastic pharaohs solidified their control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis, from which they could control the force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical routes to the Levant. The increasing power and wealth of the pharaohs during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified pharaoh after his death.(Shaw (2002) p. 70) The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labor, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.()

of the Two Lands.(Robins (1997) p. 32)
Old Kingdom

Stunning advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the Kingdom, fueled by the increased productivity made possible by a well-developed central administration.(James (2005) p. 40)  Some of Ancient Egypts crowning achievements, the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx, were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve yield, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a justice system to maintain peace and order.(Shaw (2002) p. 102) Along with the rising importance of a central administration arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. By the end of the Old Kingdom, five centuries of these feudal practices had slowly eroded the power of the pharaoh, who could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.(Shaw (2002) pp. 1167) As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC,() ultimately caused the country to enter a 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.(Clayton (1994) p. 69)
First Intermediate Period

After Egypts government collapsed at the end of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the countrys economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their newfound independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richera fact demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.(Shaw (2002) p. 120) In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.(Shaw (2002) p. 146)

Free from their loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and power. By 2160 BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055 BC the Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands and inaugurating a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.(Clayton (1994) p. 29)

Middle Kingdom





The pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom restored the countrys prosperity and stability, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.(Shaw (2002) p. 148) Mentuhotep II and his 11th Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier I, upon assuming kingship at the beginning of the 12th Dynasty around 1985 BC, shifted the nations capital to the city of Itjtawy located in Faiyum.(Clayton (1994) p. 79) From Itjtawy, the pharaohs of the 12th Dynasty undertook a far-sighted reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in Nubia rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the Walls-of-the-Ruler, to defend against foreign attack.(Shaw (2002) p. 158)

Having secured military and political security and vast agricultural and mineral wealth, the nations population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in expressions of personal piety and what could be called a democratization of the afterlife, in which all people possessed a soul and could be welcomed into the company of the gods after death.(Shaw (2002) pp. 17982) Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style,( and the relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured
subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical perfection.(Robins (1997) p. 90)

The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, III, allowed Asiatic settlers into the delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later 13th and 14th dynasties. During this decline, the foreign Asiatic settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.(Shaw (2002) p. 188)

Second Intermediate Period and the Hyksos



Around 1785 BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, Asiatic immigrants living in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris seized control of the region and forced the central government to retreat to Thebes, where the pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.(Ryholt (1997) p. 310) The Hyksos (foreign rulers) imitated Egyptian models of government and portrayed themselves as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their Middle Bronze Age culture.(Shaw (2002) p. 189)

After their retreat, the Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Hyksos to the north and the Hyksos Nubian allies, the Kushites, to the south. After years of inaction tenuous, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555 BC ( The pharaohs Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians, but it was Kamoses successor, I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos presence in Egypt. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypts borders and secure her complete dominance of the East.(Shaw (2002) p. 224)



New Kingdom



The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbors. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.  When Tuthmosis III died in 1425 BC, Egypt extended from Niya in north Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.(James (2005) p. 48)  The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to legitimize her claim to the throne.() Her successful reign was marked by trading expeditions to Punt, an elegant temple, a colossal pair of obelisks and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Hatshepsuts nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III sought to erase her legacy near the end of his reign, possibly in retaliation for usurping his throne.(Clayton (1994) p. 108)

Around 1350 BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun god Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of other deities, and attacked the power of the priestly establishment.(Aldred (1988) p. 259) Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to foreign affairs and absorbed himself in his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, and the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb erased all mention of Akhenatens heresy, now known as the Period.(Cline (2001) p. 273)

Around 1279 BC, II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history.(From his two principal wives and large harem, Ramesses II sired more than 100 children. Clayton (1994) p. 146) A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the of Kadesh and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around 1258 BC.(Tyldesley (2001) pp. 767) Egypts wealth, however, made it a tempting target for invasion, particularly by the Libyans and the Peoples. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of Syria and Palestine. The impact of external threats was exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery and civil unrest. The high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their growing power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.(James (2005) p. 54)

 Third Intermediate Period 

Following the death of XI in 1078 BC, Smendes assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in name only.(Cerny (1975) p. 645) During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under I in 945 BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis, and Kushites threatened from the south.

Drawing on millennia of interaction (trade, acculturation, occupation, assimilation, and war()) with Northern Egyptians,() the Kushite king Piye left his spiritual homeland in Napata and invaded Northern Egypt around 727 BC.  Piye easily seized control of Thebes and eventually the Delta(Shaw (2002) p. 345) and recorded the episode on his stela of victory.  Piye set the stage for subsequent 25th dynasty pharaohs,() such as Taharqa, to reunite the Two lands of Northern and Southern Egypt.  The reunited Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom.  The 25th dynasty ushered in a renaissance period for Ancient Egypt.()   Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms.  Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, Jebel Barkal, etc.()   It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.()()()

Egypts far-reaching prestige declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the Assyrian sphere of influence, and by 700 BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667 BC the Assyrians began their attack on Egypt. The reigns of both Kushite kings Taharqa and his successor, Tanutamun, were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom the Nubian rulers enjoyed several victories.(The Kushite Conquest of Egypt, Ancient~Sudan: Nubia.) Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and sacked the temples of Thebes.(Shaw (2002) p. 358)


Late Period

With no permanent plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. By 653 BC, the Saite king I was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypts first navy. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of Naukratis became the home of Greeks in the delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525 BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh III at the battle of Pelusium. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.(Shaw (2002) p. 383)

Following its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh dynasty, ended in 402 BC, and from 380343 BC the Thirtieth Dynasty ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt, which ended with the kingship of II. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the Thirty-First Dynasty, began in 343 BC, but shortly after, in 332 BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to the Great without a fight.(Shaw (2002) p. 385)

Ptolemaic Dynasty

In 332 BC, the Great conquered Egypt with little resistance from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexanders successors, the Ptolemies, was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Greek rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous of Alexandria.(Shaw (2002) p. 405) The of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city&mdash;as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.(Shaw (2002) p. 411)

Greek culture did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities, such as Serapis, and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV.(Shaw (2002) p. 418) In addition, as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful Syrian opponents made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.(James (2005) p. 62)

Roman Period

Egypt became a province of the Empire in 30 BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.(James (2005) p. 63) Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.(Shaw (2002) p. 426)

Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.(Shaw (2002) p. 422) The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some of the Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.(

From the mid-1st century, Christianity took root in Alexandria as it was seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from paganism and threatened the popular religious traditions. This led to persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.(Shaw (2003) p. 431) In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.(The Church in Ancient Society, Henry Chadwick, p. 373, Oxford University Press US, 2001, ISBN 0-19-924695-5) Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.(Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D 100400, MacMullen, p. 63, Yale University Press, 1984, ISBN 0-300-03216-1) As a consequence, Egypts pagan culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak their language, the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.(Shaw (2002) p. 445)

Government and economy
Administration and commerce



The pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the vizier, who acted as the kings representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives.(Manuelian (1998) p. 358) At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they houses of worship, but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nations wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers, who redistributed grain and goods.(Manuelian (1998) p. 363)

Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period, they did use a type of money-barter system,(Meskell (2004) p. 23) with standard sacks of grain and the deben, a weight of roughly  of copper or silver, forming a common denominator.(Manuelian (1998) p. 372) Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5 sacks (200 kg or 400 lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn 7 sacks (250 kg or 550 lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140 deben.( Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.( During the 5th century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of metal rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.(Walbank (1984) p. 125)

Social status
Egyptian society was highly stratified, and status was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or noble family that owned the land.(Manuelian (1998) p. 383) Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corve system.(James (2005) p. 136) Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, the so-called white kilt class in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.(Billard (1978) p. 109) The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. Slavery was known in ancient Egypt, but the extent and prevalence of its practice are unclear.()

The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes except slaves, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress.( Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court. Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun. Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, served only secondary roles in the temples, and were not as likely to be as educated as men.( Also see a BBC History article online for more information on equality in ancient Egypt.(A maintained BBC History article by Dr. Joann Fletcher (last updated 5Nov2009).)



Legal system
The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Maat.( Although no codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes.() Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.( More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.(Oakes (2003) p. 472)

Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminals family.( Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a yes or no question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.(McDowell (1999) p. 168)

Agriculture





A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.(Manuelian (1998) p. 361)

Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.(Nicholson (2000) p. 514) From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.(Nicholson (2000) p. 506)

The ancient Egyptians cultivated emmer and barley, and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.(Nicholson (2000) p. 510) Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.(Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630)



Animals

The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.(Strouhal (1989) p. 117) Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry such as ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.(Manuelian (1998) p. 381) The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and they provided both honey and wax.(Nicholson (2000) p. 409)

The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden, and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual.( Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, and the camel, although known from the New Kingdom, was not used as a beast of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period, but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land.( Dogs, cats and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.( During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.(Oakes (2003) p. 229)

Natural resources

Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and jewelry.(Greaves (1929) p. 123) Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster.(Lucas (1962) p. 413) Ore-bearing formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.(Nicholson (2000) p. 28) Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.(C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Sulfur. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC)

The Egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai.(Scheel (1989) p. 14) Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.(Nicholson (2000) p. 166) High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.(Nicholson (2000) p. 51)

Trade

The ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt. In the Predynastic Period, they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs.(Shaw (2002) p. 72) An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.(Naomi Porat and Edwin van den Brink (editor), An Egyptian Colony in Southern Palestine During the Late Predynastic to Early Dynastic, in The Nile Delta in Transition: 4th to 3rd Millennium BC (1992), pp. 433440.) Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.(Naomi Porat, Local Industry of Egyptian Pottery in Southern Palestine During the Early Bronze I Period, in Bulletin of the Egyptological, Seminar 8 (1986/1987), pp. 109129. See also University College London web post, 2000.)

By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian trade with Byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.(Shaw (2002) p. 322) Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lazuli, which had to be imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypts Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of oil.(Manuelian (1998) p. 145) In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.(Harris (1990) p. 13)

Language


Historical development



The language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and languages.(Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137) It has the second longest history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200 BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of Ancient Egyptian are Egyptian, Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.(Loprieno (2004) p. 161) Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.(Loprieno (2004) p. 162)

Ancient Egyptian was a language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian develops prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replace the older inflectional suffixes. There is a change from the older verbsubjectobject order to subjectverbobject.(Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137-38) The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Arabic.(Vittman (1991) pp. 197227)

Sounds and grammar

Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Later Egyptian to about nine.(Loprieno (1995a) p. 46) The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the person. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton  is the semantic core of the word hear; its basic conjugation is  he hears. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:(Loprieno (1995a) p. 74)  the woman hears.

Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic.(Loprieno (2004) p. 175) The word order is  in verbal and adjectival sentences, and  in nominal and adverbial sentences.(Allen (2000) pp. 67, 70, 109) The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.(Loprieno (2005) p. 2147) Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n, but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).(Loprieno (2004) p. 173)

Writing



Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|upright|The Rosetta stone (ca 196 BC) enabled linguists to begin the process of hieroglyph decipherment.(Allen (2000) p. 13)

Hieroglyphic writing dates to c. 3200 BC, and is composed of some 500 symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writingalong with formal hieroglyphsthat accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.

Around the 1st century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs.(Allen (2000) p. 7) Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the 4th century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine(Loprieno (2004) p. 166) and Islamic periods in Egypt,(El-Daly (2005) p. 164) but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.(Allen (2000) p. 8)

Literature



Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Edwin Smith surgical papyrus (ca 16th century BC) describes anatomy and medical treatments and is written in hieratic.

Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.(Strouhal (1989) p. 235) Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the Pyramid and Texts, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC. Later Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of Harkhuf and Weni. The genre known as Sebayt (Instructions) was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the Ipuwer papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing disasters and social upheaval, is a famous example.

The of Sinuhe, written in Egyptian, might be the classic of Egyptian literature.(Lichtheim (1975) p. 11) Also written at this time was the Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.(Lichtheim (1975) p. 215) The of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature.(Wisdom in Ancient Israel, John Day,/John Adney Emerton,/Robert P. Gordon/ Hugh Godfrey/Maturin Williamson, p23, Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-521-62489-4) Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the of Wenamun and the of Any. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700 BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Graeco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as II.(Lichtheim (1980) p. 159)

Culture
 Daily life 





Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling flour and a small oven for baking bread.(Manuelian (1998) p. 401) Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.(Manuelian (1998) p. 403)

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness, and aromatic perfumes and ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.(Manuelian (1998) p. 405) Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the familys income.(Manuelian (1998) pp. 4067)

Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, and drums and imported lutes and lyres from Asia.() The sistrum was a rattle-like instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. Senet, a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was mehen, which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and games were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Hasan.(Manuelian (1998) p. 126) The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers village of el-Madinah has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community can be studied in such detail.(The Cambridge Ancient History: II Part I , The Middle East and the Aegean Region, c.1800-13380 B.C, Edited I.E.S EdwardsC.JGaddN.G.L Hammond-E.Sollberger, Cambridge at the University Press, p. 380, 1973, ISBN 0-521-08230-7)

Cuisine


Egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time; indeed, the cuisine of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.(Manuelian (1998) pp. 399400)



Architecture


F-E-CAMERON EGYPT 2006 FEB 00289.JPG|thumb|The well preserved Temple of Horus at Edfu is an exemplar of Egyptian architecture.
The architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large structures with accuracy and precision.(Clarke (1990) pp. 947)

The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in Malkata and Amarna, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs.(Badawy (1968) p. 50) Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of bricks. The architectural elements used in the worlds first large-scale stone building, Djosers mortuary complex, include and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.

The earliest preserved ancient temples, such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the pylon, the open courtyard, and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temples sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Graeco-Roman period.() The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other. Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs.(Dodson (1991) p. 23)  The 25th dynasty was a notable exception, as all 25th dynasty pharaohs constructed pyramids.()()()

Art

30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|upright|The Bust of Nefertiti, by the sculptor Thutmose, is one of the most famous masterpieces of ancient Egyptian art.

The ancient Egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.(Robins (1997) p. 29) These artistic standardssimple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depthcreated a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.(Robins (1997) p. 21) Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.(Robins (2001) p. 12)

Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone to carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.(Nicholson (2000) p. 105) Pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of art, such as shabti statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.(James (2005) p. 122) During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.(Robins (1998) p. 74)

Despite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris.(Shaw (2002) p. 216) The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenatens revolutionary religious ideas.(Robins (1998) p. 149) This style, known as art, was quickly and thoroughly erased after Akhenatens death and replaced by the traditional forms.(Robins (1998) p. 158)

Religious beliefs

Beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting creation myths and stories into a coherent system.(James (2005) p. 102) These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.(The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology, edited by B. Redford, p. 106, Berkley, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X)

File:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The statue provided a physical place for the Ka to manifest.

Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the kings behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the gods domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.(James (2005) p. 117) After the New Kingdom, the pharaohs role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.(Shaw (2002) p. 313)

The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects. In addition to the body, each person had a wt (shadow), a ba (personality or soul), a ka (life-force), and a name.(Allen (2000) pp. 79, 945) The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the blessed dead, living on as an akh, or effective one. For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a feather of truth. If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.(Wasserman, et al. (1994) pp. 1503)

Burial customs


The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.( Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in jars.()



By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.()

Wealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, books of the dead were included in the grave, along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.() Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.(James (2005) p. 124)

 Military 



File:Egyptian-Chariot.png|thumb|right|An Egyptian chariot.

The ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypts domination in the Near East. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer Kush and parts of the Levant.(Shaw (2002) p. 245)

Typical military equipment included bows and arrows, spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the Khopesh was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.(Manuelian (1998) pp. 36667) The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army, it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as Tao II and his sons, did do so.(Clayton (1994) p. 96) although it has also been argued that kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops.() Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.(Shaw (2002) p. 400)

Technology, medicine, and mathematics

Technology

In technology, medicine and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism, as evidenced by the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri (c. 1600 BC), is first credited to Egypt, and the roots of the scientific method can also be traced back to the ancient Egyptians. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.


Faience and glass
Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience, which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper.(Nicholson (2000) p. 177) The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.(Nicholson (2000) p. 109)

The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.(Nicholson (2000) p. 195) It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.(Nicholson (2000) p. 215)

Medicine


The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The life-long labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).(Filer (1995) p. 94)

The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted periodontal disease.(Filer (1995) pp. 7880) Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.(Filer (1995) p. 21) Adult expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.(Figures are given for adult life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy at birth. Filer (1995) p. 25)

Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, like Imhotep, remained famous long after their deaths.(Filer (1995) p. 39) Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.(Strouhal (1989) p. 243) Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or House of Life institution, most notably those headquartered in Per-Bastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and Sas in the Late period. papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.(Stroual (1989) pp. 24446)

Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,(Stroual (1989) p. 250) while opium was used to relieve pain. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until he died.(Filer (1995) p. 38)

Shipbuilding

Early Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull as early as 3000 BC. The Institute of America reports(Ward, Cheryl. Worlds Oldest Planked Boats, in Archaeology (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). Archaeological Institute of America.) that some of the oldest ships yet unearthed are known as the Abydos boats. These are a group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos that were constructed of wooden planks sewn together. Discovered by Egyptologist David OConnor of York University,(Schuster, Angela M.H. This Old Boat, 11 December 2000. Archaeological Institute of America.) woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together,( and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.( Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy,( originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC,( and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating.( The ship dating to 3000 BC was  long( and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh.( According to professor OConnor, the 5,000-year-old ship may have even belonged to Pharaoh Aha.(

Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together, using pitch for caulking the seams. The ship, a 43.6-meter vessel sealed into a pit in the pyramid complex at the foot of the Pyramid of Giza in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a barque. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with and tenon joints.( Despite the ancient Egyptians ability to construct very large boats to sail along the easily navigable Nile, they were not known as good sailors and did not engage in widespread sailing or shipping in the Mediterranean or Red Seas.

 Mathematics 



The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic Naqada period, and show a fully developed system.(Understanding of Egyptian mathematics is incomplete due to paucity of available material and lack of exhaustive study of the texts that have been uncovered. Imhausen et al. (2007) p. 13) The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor and grain.(Imhausen et al. (2007) p. 11) Texts such as the Mathematical Papyrus and the Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operationsaddition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionuse fractions, compute the volumes of boxes and pyramids, and calculate the surface areas of rectangles, triangles, circles and even spheres. They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of equations.(Clarke (1990) p. 222)

 eradefault

notation was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.(Clarke (1990) p. 217) Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this.(Clarke (1990) p. 218) Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph&mdash;the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.(Gardiner (1957) p. 197)

Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had a grasp of the principles underlying the theorem, knowing, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 345 ratio.(Strouhal (1989) p. 241) They were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting one-ninth from its diameter and squaring the result:

:Area  ()D2  ()r 2  3.16r 2,

a reasonable approximation of the formula r 2.((Imhausen et al. (2007) p. 31)

The ratio seems to be reflected in many Egyptian constructions, including the pyramids, but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.(Kemp (1989) p. 138)

 Legacy 






The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.(Siliotti (1998) p. 8) The Romans also imported materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.(Siliotti (1998) p. 10) 

During the Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam, but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as al-Misri and al-Maqrizi.(El-Daly (2005) p. 112) In the 17th and 18th centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.(Siliotti (1998) p. 13) 

Although the European colonial occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the countrys historical legacy, some foreigners had more positive results. Napoleon, for example, arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypts history, which was published in the Description de lgypte.(Siliotti (1998) p. 100) 

In the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The Council of Antiquities now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.

Antimony ( ;(In the UK, the variable vowel  is usually pronounced as a schwa ; in the US, it is generally a full .) ) is a toxic element with the symbol Sb and an number of 51.  A lustrous grey metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the mineral stibnite (Sb2S3).  Although the use of antimony is limited by its toxicity, its compounds have been of fundamental value in chemistry  a prominent example being the development of superacids derived from pentafluoride.(  Antimony compounds are prominent retardants found in many commercial and domestic products.  Certain alloys are valuable for use in solders and bearings.  An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics.

History
File:antimony-symbol.svg|left|70px|thumb|altAn unshaded circle surmounted by a cross.|One of the symbols for antimony
Antimonys sulfide compound, sulfide, Sb2S3 was recognized in antiquity, at least as early as 3000 BC.

An artefact, said to be part of a vase, made of antimony dating to about 3000 BC was found at Tello, Chaldea (part of present-day Iraq), and a copper object plated with antimony dating between 2500 BC and 2200 BC has been found in Egypt.( One contemporary (Austen, at a lecture by Herbert Gladstone, published in 1892) was reported() to comment that we only know of antimony at the present day as a highly brittle and crystalline metal, which could hardly be fashioned into a useful vase, and therefore this remarkable find must represent the lost art of rendering antimony malleable.(  However, Moorey was unconvinced that the artefact was indeed a vase, mentioning that Selimkhanov, after his analysis of the Telloh object (published in 1975), attempted to relate the metal to Transcaucasian natural antimony (i.e. native metal) and that the antimony objects from Transcaucasia are all small personal ornaments.(  This weakens the evidence for a lost art of rendering antimony malleable.

The first European description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book la pirotechnia of 1540 by Biringuccio. This book predates the more famous 1556 book by Agricola, re metallica, even though Agricola has been often incorrectly credited with the discovery of metallic antimony.  A text describing the preparation of metallic antimony that was published in Germany in 1604 purported to date from the early fifteenth century, and if authentic it would predate Biringuccio. The book, written in Latin, was called Currus Triumphalis Antimonii (The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony), and its putative author was a certain Benedictine monk, writing under the name Valentinus.(Already in 1710 Wilhelm Gottlob Freiherr von Leibniz, after careful inquiry, concluded that the work was spurious, that there was no monk named Basilius Valentinus, and the books author was its ostensible editor, Johann Thlde (ca. 1565-ca. 1624). There is now agreement among professional historians that the Currus Triumphalis... was written after the middle of the sixteenth century and that Thlde was likely its author.)(s.v. Basilius Valentinus. Harold Jantz was perhaps the only modern scholar to deny Thldes authorship, but he too agrees that the work dates from after 1550: see his catalogue of German Baroque literature.) An English translation of the Triumphalis appeared in English in 1660, under the title Triumphant Chariot of Antimony. The work remains of great interest, chiefly because it documents how followers of the renegade German physician, Philippus Theophrastus Paracelsus von Hohenheim (of whom Thlde was one), came to associate the practice of alchemy with the preparation of chemical medicines.

Pure antimony was well known to ibn Hayyn, sometimes called the Father of Chemistry, in the 8th century. Here there is still an open controversy: Berthelot, who translated a number of Jbirs books, stated that antimony is never mentioned in them, but other authors() claim that Berthelot translated only some of the less important books, while the more interesting ones (some of which might describe antimony) are not yet translated, and their content is completely unknown.

The first natural occurrence of pure antimony (native antimony) in the crust was described by the Swedish scientist and local mine district engineer von Swab in 1783. The type-sample was collected from the Silver Mine in the Bergslagen mining district of Sala, Vstmanland, Sweden.()

Etymology
The ancient words for antimony mostly have, as their chief meaning, kohl, the sulfide of antimony. the Elder, however, distinguishes between male and female forms of antimony; his male form is probably the sulfide, while the female form, which is superior, heavier, and less friable, is probably native metallic antimony.(Pliny, Natural history, 33.33; W.H.S. Jones, the Classical Library translator, supplies a note suggesting the identifications.)

The Egyptians called antimony mdmt; in hieroglyphs, the vowels are uncertain, but there is an Arabic tradition that the word is  mesdemet.()( quotes Meyerhof, the translator of the book he is reviewing.) The Greek word,  stimmi, is probably a word from Arabic or Egyptian sdm O34:D46-G17-F21:D4, and is used by the Attic tragic poets of the 5th century BC; later Greeks also used  stibi, as did Celsus and Pliny, writing in Latin, in the first century AD. Pliny also gives the names stimi sic, larbaris, alabaster, and the very common platyophthalmos, wide-eye (from the effect of the cosmetic). Later Latin authors adapted the word to Latin as stibium. The Arabic word for the substance, as opposed to the cosmetic, can appear as     ithmid, athmoud, othmod, or uthmod. Littr suggests the first form, which is the earliest, derives from stimmida, (one) accusative for stimmi.(LSJ, s.v., vocalisation, spelling, and declension vary; Endlich, p.28; Celsus, 6.6.6 ff; Pliny Natural History 33.33; Lewis and Short: Latin Dictionary. OED, s. antimony.)

The use of Sb as the standard chemical symbol for antimony is due to the 18th century chemical pioneer, Jakob Berzelius, who used this abbreviation of the name stibium.(In his long article on chemical reactions and nomenclature -- Jns Jacob Berzelius, Essay on the cause of chemical proportions, and on some circumstances relating to them:  together with a short and easy method of expressing them, Annals of Philosophy, vol. 2, pages 443-454 (1813) and vol. 3, pages 51-62, 93-106, 244-255, 353-364 (1814) -- on page 52, Berzelius lists the symbol for antimony as St ; however, starting on page 248, Berzelius subsequently uses the symbol Sb for antimony.) The medieval Latin form, from which the modern languages and late Greek, take their names, is antimonium. The origin of this is uncertain; all suggestions have some difficulty either of form or interpretation. The popular etymology, from  anti-monachos or French antimoine, still has adherents; this would mean monk-killer, and is explained by many early alchemists being monks, and antimony being poisonous.(The use of a symbol resembling an upside down female symbol for antimony could also hint at a satirical pun in this origin) So does the hypothetical Greek word  antimonos, against one, explained as not found as metal, or not found unalloyed.(Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 5th ed. 2004. Entry for antimony.)( Fernando even derives it from the story of how Basil Valentine and his fellow monastic alchemists poisoned themselves by working with antimony; antimonium is found two centuries before his time. Popular etymology from OED; as for antimonos, the pure negative would be more naturally expressed by a- not.)
Lippmann conjectured a Greek word,  anthemonion, which would mean floret, and he cites several examples of related Greek words (but not that one) which describe chemical or biological efflorescence.(Lippman, pp. 6435)

The early uses of antimonium include the translations, in 10501100, by the African of Arabic medical treatises.(Lippman, p. 642, writing in 1919, says zuerst.) Several authorities believe that antimonium is a scribal corruption of some Arabic form; Meyerhof derives it from ithmid;(Meyerhof as quoted in Sarton, asserts that ithmid or athmoud became corrupted in the medieval traductions barbaro-latines.; the OED asserts that some Arabic form is the origin, and
if ithmid is the root, posits athimodium, atimodium, atimonium, as intermediate forms.) other possibilities include Athimar, the Arabic name of the metal, and a hypothetical as-stimmi, derived from or parallel to the Greek.(Endlich, p.28; one of the advantages of as-stimmi would be that it has a whole syllable in common with antimonium.)

Characteristics
Properties

massive.jpg|thumb|altAn irregular piece of silvery stone with spots of variation in lustre and shade.|Native antimony with oxidation products
Antimony is in the group (group 15) and has an electronegativity of 2.05. As expected by periodic trends, it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth, and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic.

Antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to form trioxide, Sb2O3.

Antimony is a silvery, lustrous gray metal that has a scale hardness of 3. Therefore, antimony by itself is never used to make hard objects: a coin made of antimony, issued in Chinas Guizhou province in 1931, was unpopular because they would wear out fast. After the first issue no others were produced.() It is resistant to attack by acids.

Four allotropes of antimony are known: a stable metallic form, and three meta-stable forms: explosive, black and yellow. Metallic antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metal. When molten antimony is slowly cooled, metallic antimony crystallizes in an hexagonal cell, isomorphic with that of the black allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony(III) trichloride. When scratched with a sharp implement, an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes given off as metallic antimony is formed; alternatively, when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed when gaseous metallic antimony is rapidly cooled. It oxidizes in air and is sometimes spontaneously combustible. At 100 C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of stibine (SbH3) at 90 C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this meta stable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.()

Isotopes

Antimony exists as two stable isotopes, 121Sb with a natural abundance of 57.36% and 123Sb with a natural abundance of 42.64%. It also has 35 radioisotopes, of which the longest-lived is 125Sb with a half-life of 2.75 years. In addition, 29 metastable states have been characterised.

Occurrence

The abundance of antimony in the Earths crust is estimated at 0.2 to 0.5 parts per million, comparable to thallium at 0.5 parts per million and silver at 0.07 ppm.() Even though this element is not abundant, it is found in over 100 mineral species. Antimony is sometimes found native, but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite (Sb2S3) which is the predominant ore mineral. Commercial forms of antimony are generally ingots, broken pieces, granules, and cast cake. Other forms are powder, shot, and crystals.

In 2005, the Peoples Republic of China was the top producer of antimony with about 84% world share followed at a distance by South Africa, Bolivia and Tajikistan, reports the Geological Survey. The mine with the largest deposits in China is Mine in Hunan province with a estimated deposit of 2.1 million metric tons.()

Production


The extraction of antimony from ores depends on the quality of the ore, which is usually a sulfide.  The sulfide is converted to an oxide and advantage is often taken of the volatility of antimony(III) oxide, which is recovered from roasting.(  This material is often used directly for the main applications, impurities being arsenic and sulfide.  Antimony can be isolated from its ore by a reduction with scrap iron:
: + 3Fe  2Sb + 3FeS

Isolating antimony from its oxide is performed by a carbothermal reduction:()

:2  +  3 C      4 Sb  +  3

Compounds

Antimony compounds are often classified into those of Sb(III) and Sb(V).(  Relative to its neighboring element As, the 5+ oxidaton state is more stable.

Oxides and hydroxides
trioxide () is formed when antimony is burnt in air.()
In the gas phase, this compound exists as , but it polymerises upon condensing.(  pentoxide, () can only be formed by oxidation by concentrated acid.() Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, tetroxide (), which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V).( Unlike phosphorus and arsenic, these various oxides are amphoteric and do not form well-defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts.

Antimonous acid  is unknown but the conjugate base sodium antimonite () forms upon fusing oxide and .( Transition metal antimonites are also known.() Antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate , forming salts containing the antimonate anion . Dehydrating metal salts containing this anion yields mixed oxides.(

Many antimony ores are sulfides, including stibnite (), pyrargyrite (), zinkenite, jamesonite, and boulangerite.( pentasulfide is non-stoichiometric and features antimony in the +3 state and S-S bonds.() Several thioantimonides are known such as  and .()

Halides
Antimony forms two series of halides,  and . The trihalides , , , and  are all molecular compounds having pyramidal molecular geometry. The trifluoride  is prepared by the reaction of  with HF:(
:  +  6 HF    2   +  3 

It is acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions  and . Molten  is a weak conductor.  The trichloride  is prepared by dissolving  in acid:
:  +  6 HCl    2   +  3

The pentahalides  and  have bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase, but in the liquid phase,  is polymeric, whereas  is monomeric.()  is a powerful Lewis acid used to make the superacid acid (HSbF6).

Oxyhalides are more common for antimony than arsenic and phosphorus. Antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form antimony oxo- (antimonyl) compounds such as SbOCl and .(

Antimonides, hydrides, and organoantimony compounds
Compounds in this class generally are described as derivatives of Sb3-.  Antimony forms antimonides with metals, such as antimonide (InSb), and silver antimonide ().(  The alkali metal and zinc antimonides, e.g. Na3Sb and Zn3Sb2, are more reactive. Treating these antimonides with acid produces the unstable gas stibine, :()
: + 3   
Stibine can also be produced by treating  salts with hydride reagents such as borohydride. Stibine decomposes spontaneously at room temperature.  Because stibine is thermodynamically unstable (positive of formation), antimony does not react with hydrogen directly.(Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.)

Organoantimony compounds are typically prepared by alkylation of antimony halides with reagents.(Elschenbroich, C. Organometallics (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. ISBN 978-3-29390-6)  A large variety of compounds are known with both Sb(III) and Sb(V) centers including mixed chloro-organic derivatives, anions, and cations.  Examples include Sb(C6H5)3 (triphenylstibine), Sb2(C6H5)4 (with an Sb-Sb bond), and cyclic Sb(C6H5)n.  Pentacoordinated organoantimony compounds are common, examples being Sb(C6H5)5 and several related halides.

Applications
Flame retardants
The main use of antimony is in the form of trioxide is used in the making of flame-proofing compounds. Markets for these flame-retardant applications include childrens clothing, toys, aircraft and automobile seat covers. It is also used in the fiberglass composites industry as an additive to resins for such items as light aircraft engine covers. The resin will burn while a flame is held to it but will extinguish itself as soon as the flame is removed.  Fireproofing consumes about half of the annual production of antimony.(Sabina C. Grund, Kunibert Hanusch, Hans J. Breunig, Hans Uwe Wolf Antimony and Antimony Compounds in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )

Alloys
Antimony forms a highly useful alloy with lead, increasing its hardness and mechanical strength.  The Sb-Pb alloy is used in lead-acid batteries.(() It is used in antifriction alloys, such as metal.() It is used as an alloy in bullets and shot,  cable sheathing, metal (e.g. for linotype printing machines()), solder  some lead-free solders contain 5% Sb,() in pewter,() and in hardening alloys with low tin content in the manufacturing of pipes.

Other applications
The second main application is as a catalyst for the production of the polymer polyethyleneterephthalate.  It is an additive in some glasses.  In the latter application, antimony oxides serve as fining agents, aiding in the removal of microscopic bubbles.  This application is mainly used for TV screens.(Bernard H.W. S. De Jong, Ruud G. C. Beerkens, Peter A. van Nijnatten Glass in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. )

Niche applications
Microelectronics
In tiny amounts, antimony is increasingly being used in the semiconductor industry as a dopant for ultra-high conductivity n-type silicon wafers() in the production of diodes, infrared detectors, and Hall-effect devices.

In the 1950s, tiny beads of a lead-antimony alloy were used to dope the emitters and collectors of NPN junction transistors with antimony.()

Medical
Few biological or medical applications exist for antimony. Treatments principally containing antimony are known as antimonials and are used as emetics.

Antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs. Antimony potassium tartrate, or tartar emetic, was once used as an anti-schistosomal drug, subsequently replaced by praziquantel.

Antimony and its compounds are used in several veterinary preparations like anthiomaline or lithium antimony thiomalate, which is used as a skin conditioner in ruminants.

Antimony has a nourishing or conditioning effect on keratinized tissues, at least in animals.
Antimony-based drugs, such as antimoniate, are also considered the drugs of choice for treatment of leishmaniasis in animals. Unfortunately, as well as having low therapeutic indices, the drugs are poor at penetrating the marrow, where some of the Leishmania amastigotes reside, and so cure of the disease  especially the visceral form  is very difficult.

Elemental antimony as an pill was once used as a medicine. It could be reused by others after ingestion.

Other uses
In the heads of some safety matches () and in reactors together with beryllium as neutron sources.

Antimony sulfides have been shown to help stabilize the friction coefficient in automotive brake pad materials.()

The semiconductor nitride doped with antimony has been proposed on theoretical grounds as being able to catalyze the splitting of water into H2 and O2.()

Precautions
Antimony and many of its compounds are toxic, and the effects of antimony poisoning are similar to poisoning. Inhalation of antimony dust is harmful and in certain cases may be fatal; in small doses, antimony causes headaches, dizziness, and depression. Larger doses such as prolonged skin contact may cause dermatitis; otherwise it can damage the kidneys and the liver, causing violent and frequent vomiting, and will lead to death in a few days.

Antimony is incompatible with strong oxidizing agents, strong acids, halogen acids, chlorine, or fluorine. It should be kept away from heat.(MSDS, Baker)

Antimony leaches from terephthalate (PET) bottles into liquids.() While levels observed for water are below water guidelines,()() juice concentrates (for which no guidelines are established) produced in the UK were found to contain up to 44.7 g/L of antimony, well above the EU limits for water of 5 g/L.()()  The guidelines are:
*Health Organization: 20 g/L
*Japan: 15 g/L(Wakayama, Hiroshi, Revision of Drinking Water Standards in Japan, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (Japan), 2003; Table 2, p. 84)
*States Environmental Protection Agency, Health Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Environment: 6 g/L
*German Federal Ministry of Environment: 5 g/L(
